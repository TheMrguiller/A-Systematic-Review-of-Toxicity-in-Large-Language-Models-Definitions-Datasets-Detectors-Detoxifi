  abstract={Background: The existence of toxic conversations in open-source platforms can degrade relationships among software developers and may negatively impact software product quality. To help mitigate this, some initial work has been done to detect toxic comments in the Software Engineering (SE) domain. Aims: Since automatically classifying an entire text as toxic or non-toxic does not help human moderators to understand the specific reason(s) for toxicity, we worked to develop an explainable toxicity detector for the SE domain. Method: Our explainable toxicity detector can detect specific spans of toxic content from SE texts, which can help human moderators by automatically highlighting those spans. This toxic span detection model, ToxiSpanSE, is trained with the 19,651 code review (CR) comments with labeled toxic spans. Our annotators labeled the toxic spans within 3,757 toxic CR samples. We explored several types of models, including one lexicon-based approach and five different transformer-based encoders. Results: After an extensive evaluation of all models, we found that our fine-tuned RoBERTa model achieved the best score with 0.88 $F1$, 0.87 precision, and 0.93 recall for toxic class tokens, providing an explainable toxicity classifier for the SE domain. Conclusion: Since ToxiSpanSE is the first tool to detect toxic spans in the SE domain, this tool will pave a path to combat toxicity in the SE community.},

  abstract={Developers from open-source communities have reported high stress levels from frequent demands for features and bug fixes and from the sometimes aggressive tone of these demands. Toxic conversations may demotivate and burn out developers, creating challenges for sustaining open source. We outline a path toward finding, understanding, and possibly mitigating such unhealthy interactions. We take a first step toward finding them, by developing and demonstrating a measurement instrument (an SVM classifier tailored for software engineering) to detect toxic discussions in GITHUB issues. We used our classifier to analyze trends over time and in different GITHUB communities, finding that toxicity varies by community and that toxicity decreased between 2012 and 2018.},

  year={2021},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1242-1245},
  abstract={The most effective method to mitigate decompression sickness in divers is hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) pre-breathing. However, divers breathing HBO2 are at risk for developing central nervous system oxygen toxicity (CNS-OT), which can manifest as symptoms that might impair a diver’s performance, or cause more serious symptoms like seizures. In this study, we have collected electrodermal activity (EDA) signals in fifteen subjects at elevated oxygen partial pressures (2.06 ATA, 35 FSW) in the "foxtrot" chamber pool at the Duke University Hyperbaric Center, while performing a cognitive stress test for up to 120 minutes. Specifically, we have computed the time-varying spectral analysis of EDA (TVSymp) as a tool for sympathetic tone assessment and evaluated its feasibility for the prediction of symptoms of CNS-OT in divers. The preliminary results show large increase in the amplitude TVSymp values derived from EDA recordings ~2 minutes prior to expert human adjudication of symptoms related to oxygen toxicity. An early detection based on TVSymp might allow the diver to take countermeasures against the dire consequences of CNS-OT which can lead to drowning.Clinical Relevance—This study provides a sensitive analysis method which indicates a significant increase in the electrodermal activity prior to human expert adjudication of symptoms related to CNS-OT.},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={This paper explores machine learning application in the case of drug discovery. We apply extreme gradient boosting and K-nearest neighbor to biomedical data and it signiflcantly outperform former studies using feature selection and proper tuning parameters. The novel application motivated by a recent circumstance that there is a need for rapid development of radio-protectors. It mainly targets the DNA of growing cancer cells, whereas it has adverse side effects, including p53-induced apoptosis of normal tissues and cells. It considered that p53 would be a target for therapeutic and mitigated radioprotection to escape from the apoptotic fate. On the other hand, many types of compounds contain several level of toxicity, so it is important to consider not only radiation protection but also the level of toxicity of candidate compounds for radioprotectors. Compounds of radio-protectors that have low toxicity and high radiation protection are expected. It is possible to do efficiently the compounds discovery using machine learning. This study predicts compounds of radioprotectors using plural machine learning methods, Extreme Gradient Boosting, K-nearest neighbor, SVM and Random Forest. We compare these methods and suggest proper methods to predict radioprotectors.},

  abstract={The increased use of online platforms for communication has made cyberbullying and toxicity detection a critical issue in recent times. This paper explores the topic of cyberbullying and toxicity detection and proposes potential solutions for identifying cyber violence and offensive language more effectively. According to the study of the algorithms in examined research papers on cyberbullying and toxicity detection, this research study presents a novel approach that achieved 90% accuracy in identifying bully text in social media comments. This is done by using machine learning algorithms such as SVM, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, KNN, and Random Forest, with SVM and Random Forest exhibiting the best performance. Additionally, the system improved the accuracy of identifying bully images in social media posts to 84.5% by using the MobileNetV2 model (DNN), which is superior to other approaches. The system is trained using a large, labeled dataset of text data to identify and classify different types of cyberbullying and toxic content. The findings suggest that the proposed models hold promise in detecting instances of cyberbullying and offensive content effectively. These results have significant implications for the development of cyberbullying and toxicity detection systems. The proposed approach can be integrated into various social media platforms and online communities to identify and mitigate cyberbullying and toxic content more efficiently. The study also highlights the need for continued research and collaboration among stakeholders to address cyberbullying and toxicity effectively.},

  year={2021},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-7},
  abstract={As the harms of online toxic language become more apparent, countering online toxic behavior is an essential application of natural language processing. The first step in managing toxic language risk is identification, but algorithmic approaches have themselves demonstrated bias. Texts containing some demographic identity terms such as gay or Black are more likely to be labeled as toxic in existing toxic language detection datasets. In many machine learning models introduced for toxic language detection, non-toxic comments containing minority and marginalized community-specific identity terms were given unreasonably high toxicity scores. To address the challenge of bias in toxic language detection, we propose a two-step training approach. A pretrained language model with a multitask learning objective will mitigate biases in the toxicity classifier prediction. Experiments demonstrate that jointly training the pretrained language model with a multitask objective can effectively mitigate the impacts of unintended biases and is more robust to model bias towards commonly-attacked identity groups presented in datasets without significantly hurting the model’s generalizability.},

We present a detailed description of the VR and the factors affecting E/sub c/.

  pages={41-55},
  abstract={Interpersonal conflict in code review, such as toxic language or an unnecessary pushback, is associated with negative outcomes such as stress and turnover. Automatic detection is one approach to prevent and mitigate interpersonal conflict. Two recent automatic detection approaches were developed in different settings: a toxicity detector using text analytics for open source issue discussions and a pushback detector using logs-based metrics for corporate code reviews. This paper tests how the toxicity detector and the pushback detector can be generalized beyond their respective contexts and discussion types, and how the combination of the two can help improve interpersonal conflict detection. The results reveal connections between the two concepts. LAY ABSTRACT Software engineers often communicate with one another on platforms that support tasks like discussing bugs and inspecting each others‘ code. Such discussions sometimes contain interpersonal conflict, which can lead to stress and abandonment. In this paper, we investigate how to automatically detect interpersonal conflict, both by analyzing the text of the what the engineers are saying and by analyzing the properties of that text.},

  year={2023},
  volume={1},
  number={},
  pages={1-5},
  abstract={The influences of Curcuma longa rhizome supplemented diet at different percentages on total protein concentration in serum, selected organs (heart, kidney and liver) and kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) of indomethacin treated rats were investigated in this study. A total of 35 mature male Wistar rats, weighing between 110 and 160g, were divided into seven groups of five rats each at random. Rats in groups A through D were fed diets supplemented with 1%, 2%, 5%, and 10% turmeric; group E received a pre-treatment of the conventional medication omeprazole (20 mg/kg) orally; and groups F and G received a 28-day supply of regular rat meal. Animals in all groups were then given a single oral dose of indomethacin (60 mg/kg b.w.), fasted for the next day (except group G), and left for six (6) hours before being sacrificed. The effect(s) of turmeric rhizome powder on total protein concentration in serum, the selected organs mentioned above and kidney KIM-1 were determined. It was revealed from this study that there was increased serum total protein concentration of animals in F and D groups compared with animals in groups G and A-C with concomitant decrease in heart and kidney protein activities in concentration dependent manner. However, there was no concomitant decrease in the liver of animals in groups G and A-C. Furthermore, the result also showed a significant $(P < 0.05)$ increased expression of the kidney injury marker, KIM-1 in groups F and D in comparison with groups G and A-C in dose dependent wise. It can therefore be concluded that consumption of turmeric at 10% of whole recipe can enhance the damaging effect of indomethacin. Nonetheless, inclusion of turmeric powder at moderate concentration between 1-5% at most could mitigate the tissue damaging effect of indomethacin and therefore serve as tissue protective agent.},

  abstract={Several phytoceuticals and extracts of medicinal plants are reported to mitigate deleterious effects of ionizing radiation. The potential of hydro-alcoholic extract of Clerodendron infortunatum (CIE) for providing protection to mice exposed to gamma radiation was investigated. Oral administration of CIE bestowed a survival advantage to mice exposed to lethal doses of gamma radiation. Radiation-induced depletion of the total blood count and bone marrow cellularity were prevented by treatment with CIE. Damage to the cellular DNA (as was evident from the comet assay and the micronucleus index) was also found to be decreased upon CIE administration. Radiation-induced damages to intestinal crypt cells was also reduced by CIE. Studies on gene expression in intestinal cells revealed that there was a marked increase in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in mice exposed to whole-body 4 Gy gamma radiation, and that administration of CIE resulted in significant lowering of this ratio, suggestive of reduction of radiation-induced apoptosis. Also, in the intestinal tissue of irradiated animals, following CIE treatment, levels of expression of the DNA repair gene Atm were found to be elevated, and there was reduction in the expression of the inflammatory Cox-2 gene. Thus, our results suggest a beneficial use of Clerodendron infortunatum for mitigating radiation toxicity.},

  abstract={Research on mitigation of toxic threats is critical to national defense, but is often hazardous. Toxicity generally arises at the molecular level via reactions between toxins and host biomolecules. This lends itself well to simulations from which one may safely derive the insight required for effective preventative or therapeutic response strategies. Thus, we have applied quantum chemical methods to address toxicity arising from both hostile (i.e., nerve agents) and inadvertent (e.g., toxic industrial chemicals) sources. Neurotoxic reactions involving inhibition of the acetylcholinesterase enzyme have been structurally and energetically characterized with mind to mitigating the process. In a complementary effort, interactions between toxins and various catalytic and filtering media have been reported with an aim of improving chemical protection devices.},

  abstract={Studies examining traumatic brain injury have suggested a 'window of opportunity' exists for therapeutic agents to mitigate edema and cellular toxicity effectively. However, successful therapy also relies on identifying the extent of blood-brain barrier disruption, which is associated with excessive extra-cellular concentrations of ions, excitatory amino acids, and serum proteins. The following study investigates the use of pH-selective hydrous iridium oxide microelectrodes to assess trauma following insertion of a neural probe. Electrochemical activation of iridium microelectrode arrays was performed in either acidic (0.5 M H2SO4) or weak basic (0.3 M Na2HPO4, pH=8.56) solutions. Both oxides demonstrated super-Nernstian pH sensitivity (-88.5 mV/pH and -77.1 mV/pH, respectively) with little interference by other cations. Data suggest that acid-grown oxide provides better potential stability than base-grown oxide (sigma=2.8 versus 4.9 mV over 5 hours). Implantation of these electrodes into motor cortex and dorsal striatum revealed significant acidosis during and following insertion. Variability in the spatiotemporal pH profile included micro-scale inhomogeneities along the probe shank and significant differences in the averaged pH response between successive insertions using the same depth and speed. This diagnostic technology has important implications for intervention therapies in order to more effectively treat acute surgical brain trauma},

  abstract={Silicon has the ability in ameliorating the negative effect of salinity on plants by reducing ionic toxicity and maintaining plant water balance, reducing oxidative stress. The present paper examines the effects of saline stress (50mM and 100mM NaCl) applied singular and in combination with SiO2 on basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) seedlings. Significant changes occurred in terms of shoot length, varying from 7.27 mm (50 mM NaCl) to 8.39 mm (50mM NaCl+SiNPs), and in the case of radicles, from 3.22 mm (SiNP) to 3.98 mm (100 mM NaCl), suggesting that salt treatment reduces shoot elongation, and SiO2 application could mitigate the saline stress effect. The activity of antioxidant enzymes in O. basilicum seedlings exposed to treatments, singular or in combination, was generally lower compared to the control. SiO2 supplement may contribute to the increase of salt tolerance, as reflected by the improvement of SOD and POD activity, especially in the combined treatment of 100 mM NaCl+SiO2.},

  abstract={In light of the widespread adoption of large language models, their susceptibility to security vulnerabilities cannot be overlooked. As a result, it has become imperative to evaluate their proficiency in addressing issues such as toxicity, bias, and disinformation. However, current research focused on appraising and mitigating security risks has predominantly concentrated on specific facets, leading to disparities in evaluation criteria. In contrast, there has been relatively limited attention given to multidimensional and universal frameworks for security evaluation. In this context, this paper delves into the realm of generic evaluation frameworks for security that offer support for cross-language and multi-category analysis. We underscore the existing challenges associated with prominent large language models concerning security issues and develop a comprehensive test data set to furnish researchers with a tool for quantifying security aspects. Through comprehensive evaluations across three major benchmark tests, we identify distinct strengths and weaknesses exhibited by each open source large language model to varying degrees. By employing a multi-dimensional security evaluation framework, we can attain a more holistic comprehension of the performance exhibited by each model across diverse security dimensions. This approach holds significant value in advancing the domain of security research and facilitating the practical application of language models.},

  abstract={In the last years research-based programs relevant to sustainability have been developed. Some technological research programs are focused on the design of systems and processes that can be useful for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions as CO2. To diminish the negative impact caused by CO2 for global warming, its chemical transformation in Dimethyl Carbonate is a promising technology. Dimethyl Carbonate is a solvent with low toxicity and due to oxidative capacity can be used as fuel additive. In this work, the membrane reactor technology to improve the Dymethyl Carbonate production is explored from the perspective of modelling and simulation. As a result, a software-based model is implemented, in order to develop and couple different models for describing the membrane reactor. Simulation results showed that the membrane reactor, compared with conventional reactor, increase the reaction conversion and Dymethyl Carbonate production up to 67% and 78%, respectively. Finally, it can be seen that the solution obtained from software-based model allows to conclude that membrane reactor is a promising technology to mitigate CO2 emissions, allowing to achieve environmental sustainability.},

  abstract={The clinical success of targeted cancer therapies is limited by the emergence of drug resistance often due to pre-existing tumor genetic heterogeneity and acquired, therapy-induced resistance. Targeted therapies have varied success in addressing metastatic disease, due to their ability to penetrate certain physiological compartments. This paper considers an evolutionary cancer model that incorporates tumor cell growth, mutation and compartmental migration and leverages recent results on the optimal control of monotone and convex systems to synthesize switching treatment strategies where a single drug or a predetermined combination of drugs is used at a given time. The need for switching is motivated by clinical considerations such as the limited effectiveness of any single targeted therapy against multiple resistance mechanisms arising in a single patient and the inability to design drug combinations at effective doses due to toxicity constraints. An optimal and clinically feasible switching therapy is obtained as the solution of a convex optimization problem that exploits the diagonally-dominant structure of the model. We demonstrate that this method yields an effective strategy in mitigating disease evolution in the presence of imperfect drug penetration in two compartments on an experimentally identified model of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-rearranged lung carcinoma.},

  abstract={Recent progress on bioresorbable and bio-compatible miniature systems provides prospects for developing novel nanorobots operating inside the human body. These nanoscale systems are expected to dissolve in vivo and cause no side effect after completing their tasks. Motivated by these advancements, we have developed the analytical framework of touchable molecular communication (TouchCom) to describe the process of direct drug targeting (DDT) using externally controllable nanorobots. Built upon our previous work, we develop a novel latticed channel model of TouchCom for an interconnected capillary network near a targeted tumor area. Specifically, we propose a two-dimensional grid to synthesize the microcirculation environment, which is used to describe the propagation process of nanorobots. Furthermore, by applying the concept of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems in wireless communications to the therapeutic window in cancer treatment, we propose a MIMO DDT strategy in the latticed channel to enhance the targeting efficiency while minimizing the adverse effect of drug toxicity. Based on the proposed model, we study the influence of blood flow direction on the efficiency of DDT, and introduce a compensation strategy with the help of an external guiding field to mitigate the misalignment between the direction of blood flow and the tumor location.},

  abstract={Environment indoor quality (EIQ) is a multifaceted problem encompassing a broad range and fluctuation of contaminants that pose risks to human health, satisfaction, welfare, and efficiency, particularly in relation to environment indoor air quality (EIAQ). The presence of indoor air pollutants (IAP) in the environment significantly influences the decline in the quality of human life, owing to the hazards associated with indoor air pollution and discomfort-causing pollutants affecting thermal comfort. This research features a proposed EIAQ monitoring and controlling system based on the environment indoor air quality index (EIAQI) for detecting, identifying, assessing, and controlling air pollutants. Further, it monitors the concentration of the gases and calculate the toxicity level of the environment status index. It also provides the output control system such as ventilation system and alert system to mitigate the air pollutants based on EIAQI automatically. The EIAQ system integrated with IoT technology to provide a monitoring application the entire air pollutant and EIAQI. As a result, the use of the indoor air quality (IAQ) system becomes a suitable method for identifying, categorizing, assessing, offering guidance, and implementing preventive measures to enhance the quality of the environment.},

  abstract={Printed electronics allow for ultra-low-cost circuit fabrication with unique properties such as flexibility, non-toxicity, and stretchability. Because of these advanced properties, there is a growing interest in adapting printed electronics for emerging areas such as fast-moving consumer goods and wearable technologies. In such domains, analog signal processing in or near the sensor is favorable. Printed neuromorphic circuits have been recently proposed as a solution to perform such analog processing natively. Additionally, their learning-based design process allows high eﬃciency of their optimization and enables them to mitigate the high process variations associated with low-cost printed processes. In this work, we address the aging of the printed components. This effect can significantly degrade the accuracy of printed neuromorphic circuits over time. For this, we develop a stochastic aging-model to describe the behavior of aged printed resistors and modify the training objective by considering the expected loss over the lifetime of the device. This approach ensures to provide acceptable accuracy over the device lifetime. Our experiments show that an overall 35.8% improvement in terms of expected accuracy over the device lifetime can be achieved using the proposed learning approach.},
