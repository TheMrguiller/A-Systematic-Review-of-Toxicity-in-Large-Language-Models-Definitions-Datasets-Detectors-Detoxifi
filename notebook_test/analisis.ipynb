       "    ('abstract', \"Social media is an effective tool for connecting with people and distributing information. However, many people often use social media to spread hate speech and abusive languages. In contrast to hate speech, abusive languages are frequently used as jokes with no purpose of offending individuals or groups, even though they may contain profanities. As a result, the distinction between hate speech and abusive language is often blurred. In many cases, individuals who spread hate speech may be prosecuted as it has legal implications. Previous research has focused on binary classification of hate speech and normal tweets. This study aims to classify hate speech, abusive language, and normal messages on Indonesian Twitter. Several machine learning models, such as logistic regression and BERT models, are utilized to accomplish text classification tasks. The model's performance is assessed using the F1-Score evaluation metric. The results show that BERT models outperform other models in terms of F1-Score, with the BERT-indobenchmark model, which was pretrained on social media text data, achieving the highest F1-Score of 85.59. This also demonstrates that pretraining the BERT model using social media data improves the classification model significantly. Developing such classification model that can distinguish between hate speech and abusive language would help individuals in preventing the spread of hate speech that has legal implications.\"), \n",

Offensive content even without profanity may result in psychological and physical harms to, particularly children and sensitive people. As of 2022, Turkey houses 7th largest Twitter community among all countries in terms of the active user size exceeding 16 million users, which represents a high diversity of people considering its population. That said, there is a growing need for a comprehensive and high-quality dataset in Turkish that can be utilized in development of NLP models for robust detection of offensive language usage in social media. Related studies in literature have mostly focused on small, synthetic and label-imbalanced datasets. Machine learning models trained on such datasets tend to favor majority class for accuracy and possess generalizability issues. However, it is challenging to create an unbiased dataset containing hate speech without offensive words, and build an accurate detection model to identify the actual hate speech Tweets. The models may lack sufficient context due to the absence of swear words. Therefore, we propose a data augmentation approach based on data mining methods utilizing the linguistic features of Turkish that can help enhance the generalizability of machine learning models without further human interaction. Furthermore, we evaluated the impact of our comprehensive dataset in detection of offensive language in social media. The NLP models training using the augmented dataset improved the macro average detection accuracy by 7.60% in comparison to the baseline approach.'), \n",

This paper explores the topic of cyberbullying and toxicity detection and proposes potential solutions for identifying cyber violence and offensive language more effectively. According to the study of the algorithms in examined research papers on cyberbullying and toxicity detection, this research study presents a novel approach that achieved 90% accuracy in identifying bully text in social media comments. This is done by using machine learning algorithms such as SVM, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, KNN, and Random Forest, with SVM and Random Forest exhibiting the best performance. Additionally, the system improved the accuracy of identifying bully images in social media posts to 84.5% by using the MobileNetV2 model (DNN), which is superior to other approaches. The system is trained using a large, labeled dataset of text data to identify and classify different types of cyberbullying and toxic content. The findings suggest that the proposed models hold promise in detecting instances of cyberbullying and offensive content effectively. These results have significant implications for the development of cyberbullying and toxicity detection systems.

       "    ('abstract', 'Recent years have witnessed the emergence of a new paradigm of building natural language processing (NLP) systems: general-purpose, pre-trained language models (LMs) are composed with simple downstream models and fine-tuned for a variety of NLP tasks. This paradigm shift significantly simplifies the system development cycles. However, as many LMs are provided by untrusted third parties, their lack of standardization or regulation entails profound security implications, which are largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, this work studies the security threats posed by malicious LMs to NLP systems. Specifically, we present TrojanLM, a new class of trojaning attacks in which maliciously crafted LMs trigger host NLP systems to malfunction in a highly predictable manner. By empirically studying three state-of-the-art LMs (BERT, GPT-2, XLNet) in a range of security-critical NLP tasks (toxic comment detection, question answering, text completion) as well as user studies on crowdsourcing platforms, we demonstrate that TrojanLM possesses the following properties: (i) flexibility - the adversary is able to flexibly define logical combinations (e.g., ‘and’, ‘or’, ‘xor’) of arbitrary words as triggers, (ii) efficacy - the host systems misbehave as desired by the adversary with high probability when “trigger” -embedded inputs are present, (iii) specificity - the trojan LMs function indistinguishably from their benign counterparts on clean inputs, and (iv) fluency - the trigger-embedded inputs appear as fluent natural language and highly relevant to their surrounding contexts. We provide analytical justification for the practicality of TrojanLM, and further discuss potential countermeasures and their challenges, which lead to several promising research directions.'), \n",

       "    ('abstract', 'This paper proposes a novelty approach to mitigate the negative transfer problem. In the field of machine learning, the common strategy is to apply the Single-Task Learning approach in order to train a supervised model to solve a specific task. Training a robust model requires a lot of data and a significant amount of computational resources, making this solution unfeasible in cases where data are unavailable or expensive to gather. Therefore another solution, based on the sharing of information between tasks, has been developed: Multi-task Learning (MTL). Despite the recent developments regarding MTL, the problem of negative transfer has still to be solved. Negative transfer is a phenomenon that occurs when noisy information is shared between tasks, resulting in a drop in performance. This paper proposes a new approach to mitigate the negative transfer problem based on the task awareness concept. The proposed approach results in diminishing the negative transfer together with an improvement of performance over classic MTL solution. Moreover, the proposed approach has been implemented in two unified architectures to detect Sexism, Hate Speech, and Toxic Language in text comments. The proposed architectures set a new state-of-the-art both in EXIST-2021 and HatEval-2019 benchmarks.'), \n",

Therefore, it is necessary to create an automatic hazardous identification system to keep people out of and restrict their access to these online settings. The prevalence of hate speech presents significant difficulties for the cyber culture. Users can wish for social media sites and online forums to support anti-hate discourse. Hate speech detection, however, is still a young technology, and system designers must come up with a way to identify unwanted hate speech while upholding the atmosphere of online freedom of speech. No method for detecting excellence has yet been put forth. Identifying the form of communication is hate speech and automatically recognising the hate speech are the two typical obstacles for a hate speech detection task. People must first decide which kinds of speech fall under the category of hate speech before screening it out. The majority of social media platforms define hate speech differently. In this day and age, Internet is necessary, and ethics has to be followed, however several parties spread hate speech deviating on race, ethnicity, and religion.

After analyzing the differences between Chinese and English, we propose a novel adversarial Chinese text generation solution Argot, by utilizing the method for adversarial English examples and several novel methods developed on Chinese characteristics. Argot could effectively and efficiently generate adversarial Chinese texts with good readability in both white-box and black-box settings. Argot could also automatically generate targeted Chinese adversarial texts, achieving a high success rate and ensuring the readability of the generated texts. Furthermore, we apply Argot to the spam detection task in both local detection models and a public toxic content detection system from a well-known security company. Argot achieves a relatively high bypass success rate with fluent readability, which proves that the real-world toxic content detection system is vulnerable to adversarial example attacks.

Biases of manual moderation can thwart the efforts taken to prevent the presence of hate speech on online platforms. However, posts that convey important meanings also fall prey to such systems, which should be avoided. Such systems fail to educate their authors what should have been done differently. Additionally, a system that combines detection and substitution algorithms is largely absent. A euphemistic substitution approach could prove to be more effective. In this project we have developed a classifier using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning to detect toxic texts and provide euphemisms to erudite the user of words that can replace the toxicity present in the original texts. The classifier informs the online platform about the toxicity of the texts so they restrict such content to available on its platform. The euphemisms are aimed to make the user aware of the toxicity in the text and suggest replacements, which, if used, can make the text inoffensive.

Therefore, changes in temperature and humidity affect the response of the hydrogen sulfide gas transmitter, and this change reduces the accuracy measured by the device. Furthermore, high-precision hydrogen sulfide detection sensors are generally expensive. This finding has important implications for developing robust gas sensors.

Thus, social media has become a perfect place for users’ malicious behaviors like committing hate crimes, spreading toxic information, abetting crimes, etc. Malicious behaviors are covert and widespread, with potential relevance regarding topic, person, place, and so on. Therefore, it is necessary to develop novel techniques to detect and disrupt malicious behavior on social media effectively. Previous research has shown promising results in extracting semantic text (speech) representation using natural language processing methods. Yet the latent relation between speeches and the connection between users behind speeches is rarely explored. In light of this, we propose a holistic model named Graph adaption BERT (GraphBERT) to detect malicious behaviors on Twitter with both semantic and relational information. Specifically, we first present a novel and a large-scale corpus of tweet data to benefit both graph-based and language-based malicious behavior detection research. Then, we design a novel model GraphBERT to learn comprehensive tweet and user representation with the integration of both semantic information encoded by transformers (i.e., BERT) and relational information encoded by graph neural network. GraphBERT further leverages a weight adaption BERT module implemented between transformer layers to refine tweet embedding using relational information for malicious tweet classification. Finally, the adapted tweet embedding is used with the initial tweet representation to generate user embedding for malicious user detection. The extensive experiments on the collected Twitter data show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods for both tasks (i.e., malicious tweet classification and malicious user detection).'), \n",

As bullying shifts from playgrounds to social media, the need of the hour is having anti-trolling softwares in place to combat this malpractice. Many internet companies have taken steps in this direction by creating softwares or applications that can prevent trolling but none have been completely successful. The word anti-trolling has existed as a concept for a long time. It is necessary to make it a concrete reality. Most of the softwares identify abusive words and simply block them but trolls have found ways to circumvent this obstacle by using clever ways. This paper explores the currently existing “Anti-trolling systems”, their methodologies and technological challenges. In particular, we consider machine learning and existing expert systems that detect and prevent trolls. The paper concludes with a discussion of the issues faced by this technology, the current functioning and a few suggestions along with a modified architecture and the vision of a trolling-free internet.'), \n",

To help mitigate this, some initial work has been done to detect toxic comments in the Software Engineering (SE) domain. Aims: Since automatically classifying an entire text as toxic or non-toxic does not help human moderators to understand the specific reason(s) for toxicity, we worked to develop an explainable toxicity detector for the SE domain. Method: Our explainable toxicity detector can detect specific spans of toxic content from SE texts, which can help human moderators by automatically highlighting those spans. This toxic span detection model, ToxiSpanSE, is trained with the 19,651 code review (CR) comments with labeled toxic spans. Our annotators labeled the toxic spans within 3,757 toxic CR samples. We explored several types of models, including one lexicon-based approach and five different transformer-based encoders. Results: After an extensive evaluation of all models, we found that our fine-tuned RoBERTa model achieved the best score with 0.88 $F1$, 0.87 precision, and 0.93 recall for toxic class tokens, providing an explainable toxicity classifier for the SE domain. Conclusion: Since ToxiSpanSE is the first tool to detect toxic spans in the SE domain, this tool will pave a path to combat toxicity in the SE community.', 'Developers from open-source communities have reported high stress levels from frequent demands for features and bug fixes and from the sometimes aggressive tone of these demands. Toxic conversations may demotivate and burn out developers, creating challenges for sustaining open source. We outline a path toward finding, understanding, and possibly mitigating such unhealthy interactions. We take a first step toward finding them, by developing and demonstrating a measurement instrument (an SVM classifier tailored for software engineering) to detect toxic discussions in GITHUB issues. We used our classifier to analyze trends over time and in different GITHUB communities, finding that toxicity varies by community and that toxicity decreased between 2012 and 2018.', 'The most effective method to mitigate decompression sickness in divers is hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) pre-breathing. However, divers breathing HBO2 are at risk for developing central nervous system oxygen toxicity (CNS-OT), which can manifest as symptoms that might impair a diver’s performance, or cause more serious symptoms like seizures. In this study, we have collected electrodermal activity (EDA) signals in fifteen subjects at elevated oxygen partial pressures (2.06 ATA, 35 FSW) in the \"foxtrot\" chamber pool at the Duke University Hyperbaric Center, while performing a cognitive stress test for up to 120 minutes. Specifically, we have computed the time-varying spectral analysis of EDA (TVSymp) as a tool for sympathetic tone assessment and evaluated its feasibility for the prediction of symptoms of CNS-OT in divers. The preliminary results show large increase in the amplitude TVSymp values derived from EDA recordings ~2 minutes prior to expert human adjudication of symptoms related to oxygen toxicity. An early detection based on TVSymp might allow the diver to take countermeasures against the dire consequences of CNS-OT which can lead to drowning.Clinical Relevance—This study provides a sensitive analysis method which indicates a significant increase in the electrodermal activity prior to human expert adjudication of symptoms related to CNS-OT.', 'This paper explores machine learning application in the case of drug discovery. We apply extreme gradient boosting and K-nearest neighbor to biomedical data and it signiflcantly outperform former studies using feature selection and proper tuning parameters. The novel application motivated by a recent circumstance that there is a need for rapid development of radio-protectors. It mainly targets the DNA of growing cancer cells, whereas it has adverse side effects, including p53-induced apoptosis of normal tissues and cells. It considered that p53 would be a target for therapeutic and mitigated radioprotection to escape from the apoptotic fate. On the other hand, many types of compounds contain several level of toxicity, so it is important to consider not only radiation protection but also the level of toxicity of candidate compounds for radioprotectors. Compounds of radio-protectors that have low toxicity and high radiation protection are expected. It is possible to do efficiently the compounds discovery using machine learning. This study predicts compounds of radioprotectors using plural machine learning methods, Extreme Gradient Boosting, K-nearest neighbor, SVM and Random Forest. We compare these methods and suggest proper methods to predict radioprotectors.', 'We propose an autonomous algorithm for mobile agents in multisensor fusion. Our algorithm is based on the concept of mutual information (MI) and the bounds obtained for correlated information. The bounds are obtained by our technique of Determinant Inequalities to maximize the mutual information to achieve the conditions for autonomy. We demonstrate the superiority our autonomous algorithm over the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in mitigating the trace element toxicity present in marine mussels.', 'The increased use of online platforms for communication has made cyberbullying and toxicity detection a critical issue in recent times. This paper explores the topic of cyberbullying and toxicity detection and proposes potential solutions for identifying cyber violence and offensive language more effectively. According to the study of the algorithms in examined research papers on cyberbullying and toxicity detection, this research study presents a novel approach that achieved 90% accuracy in identifying bully text in social media comments. This is done by using machine learning algorithms such as SVM, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, KNN, and Random Forest, with SVM and Random Forest exhibiting the best performance. Additionally, the system improved the accuracy of identifying bully images in social media posts to 84.5% by using the MobileNetV2 model (DNN), which is superior to other approaches. The system is trained using a large, labeled dataset of text data to identify and classify different types of cyberbullying and toxic content. The findings suggest that the proposed models hold promise in detecting instances of cyberbullying and offensive content effectively. These results have significant implications for the development of cyberbullying and toxicity detection systems. The proposed approach can be integrated into various social media platforms and online communities to identify and mitigate cyberbullying and toxic content more efficiently. The study also highlights the need for continued research and collaboration among stakeholders to address cyberbullying and toxicity effectively.', 'As the harms of online toxic language become more apparent, countering online toxic behavior is an essential application of natural language processing. The first step in managing toxic language risk is identification, but algorithmic approaches have themselves demonstrated bias. Texts containing some demographic identity terms such as gay or Black are more likely to be labeled as toxic in existing toxic language detection datasets. In many machine learning models introduced for toxic language detection, non-toxic comments containing minority and marginalized community-specific identity terms were given unreasonably high toxicity scores. To address the challenge of bias in toxic language detection, we propose a two-step training approach. A pretrained language model with a multitask learning objective will mitigate biases in the toxicity classifier prediction. Experiments demonstrate that jointly training the pretrained language model with a multitask objective can effectively mitigate the impacts of unintended biases and is more robust to model bias towards commonly-attacked identity groups presented in datasets without significantly hurting the model’s generalizability.', 'The virtual range (VR) is an environment that integrates in a seamless fashion several models to improve complex systems visualization. A complex system is a nonlinear system of systems whose interactions bring together interesting emergent properties that are very difficult to visualize and/or study by using the traditional approach of decomposition. The VR toxicity model as described here represents the different systems that interact in the determination of the expectation of casualties (E/sub c/) resulting from the toxic effects of the gas dispersion that occurs after a disaster affecting a space shuttle within 120 seconds of liftoff. We present a detailed description of the VR and the factors affecting E/sub c/. The system helps local authorities to estimate the population at risk in order to plan for areas to evacuate and/or for the resources required to provide aid and comfort and mitigate damages in case of a disaster.', 'Interpersonal conflict in code review, such as toxic language or an unnecessary pushback, is associated with negative outcomes such as stress and turnover. Automatic detection is one approach to prevent and mitigate interpersonal conflict. Two recent automatic detection approaches were developed in different settings: a toxicity detector using text analytics for open source issue discussions and a pushback detector using logs-based metrics for corporate code reviews. This paper tests how the toxicity detector and the pushback detector can be generalized beyond their respective contexts and discussion types, and how the combination of the two can help improve interpersonal conflict detection. The results reveal connections between the two concepts. LAY ABSTRACT Software engineers often communicate with one another on platforms that support tasks like discussing bugs and inspecting each others‘ code. Such discussions sometimes contain interpersonal conflict, which can lead to stress and abandonment. In this paper, we investigate how to automatically detect interpersonal conflict, both by analyzing the text of the what the engineers are saying and by analyzing the properties of that text.', 'The influences of Curcuma longa rhizome supplemented diet at different percentages on total protein concentration in serum, selected organs (heart, kidney and liver) and kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) of indomethacin treated rats were investigated in this study. A total of 35 mature male Wistar rats, weighing between 110 and 160g, were divided into seven groups of five rats each at random. Rats in groups A through D were fed diets supplemented with 1%, 2%, 5%, and 10% turmeric; group E received a pre-treatment of the conventional medication omeprazole (20 mg/kg) orally; and groups F and G received a 28-day supply of regular rat meal. Animals in all groups were then given a single oral dose of indomethacin (60 mg/kg b.w.), fasted for the next day (except group G), and left for six (6) hours before being sacrificed. The effect(s) of turmeric rhizome powder on total protein concentration in serum, the selected organs mentioned above and kidney KIM-1 were determined. It was revealed from this study that there was increased serum total protein concentration of animals in F and D groups compared with animals in groups G and A-C with concomitant decrease in heart and kidney protein activities in concentration dependent manner. However, there was no concomitant decrease in the liver of animals in groups G and A-C. Furthermore, the result also showed a significant $(P < 0.05)$ increased expression of the kidney injury marker, KIM-1 in groups F and D in comparison with groups G and A-C in dose dependent wise. It can therefore be concluded that consumption of turmeric at 10% of whole recipe can enhance the damaging effect of indomethacin. Nonetheless, inclusion of turmeric powder at moderate concentration between 1-5% at most could mitigate the tissue damaging effect of indomethacin and therefore serve as tissue protective agent.', 'Several phytoceuticals and extracts of medicinal plants are reported to mitigate deleterious effects of ionizing radiation. The potential of hydro-alcoholic extract of Clerodendron infortunatum (CIE) for providing protection to mice exposed to gamma radiation was investigated. Oral administration of CIE bestowed a survival advantage to mice exposed to lethal doses of gamma radiation. Radiation-induced depletion of the total blood count and bone marrow cellularity were prevented by treatment with CIE. Damage to the cellular DNA (as was evident from the comet assay and the micronucleus index) was also found to be decreased upon CIE administration. Radiation-induced damages to intestinal crypt cells was also reduced by CIE. Studies on gene expression in intestinal cells revealed that there was a marked increase in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in mice exposed to whole-body 4 Gy gamma radiation, and that administration of CIE resulted in significant lowering of this ratio, suggestive of reduction of radiation-induced apoptosis. Also, in the intestinal tissue of irradiated animals, following CIE treatment, levels of expression of the DNA repair gene Atm were found to be elevated, and there was reduction in the expression of the inflammatory Cox-2 gene. Thus, our results suggest a beneficial use of Clerodendron infortunatum for mitigating radiation toxicity.', 'Research on mitigation of toxic threats is critical to national defense, but is often hazardous. Toxicity generally arises at the molecular level via reactions between toxins and host biomolecules. This lends itself well to simulations from which one may safely derive the insight required for effective preventative or therapeutic response strategies. Thus, we have applied quantum chemical methods to address toxicity arising from both hostile (i.e., nerve agents) and inadvertent (e.g., toxic industrial chemicals) sources. Neurotoxic reactions involving inhibition of the acetylcholinesterase enzyme have been structurally and energetically characterized with mind to mitigating the process. In a complementary effort, interactions between toxins and various catalytic and filtering media have been reported with an aim of improving chemical protection devices.', \"Studies examining traumatic brain injury have suggested a 'window of opportunity' exists for therapeutic agents to mitigate edema and cellular toxicity effectively. However, successful therapy also relies on identifying the extent of blood-brain barrier disruption, which is associated with excessive extra-cellular concentrations of ions, excitatory amino acids, and serum proteins. The following study investigates the use of pH-selective hydrous iridium oxide microelectrodes to assess trauma following insertion of a neural probe. Electrochemical activation of iridium microelectrode arrays was performed in either acidic (0.5 M H2SO4) or weak basic (0.3 M Na2HPO4, pH=8.56) solutions. Both oxides demonstrated super-Nernstian pH sensitivity (-88.5 mV/pH and -77.1 mV/pH, respectively) with little interference by other cations. Data suggest that acid-grown oxide provides better potential stability than base-grown oxide (sigma=2.8 versus 4.9 mV over 5 hours). Implantation of these electrodes into motor cortex and dorsal striatum revealed significant acidosis during and following insertion. Variability in the spatiotemporal pH profile included micro-scale inhomogeneities along the probe shank and significant differences in the averaged pH response between successive insertions using the same depth and speed. This diagnostic technology has important implications for intervention therapies in order to more effectively treat acute surgical brain trauma\", 'Silicon has the ability in ameliorating the negative effect of salinity on plants by reducing ionic toxicity and maintaining plant water balance, reducing oxidative stress. The present paper examines the effects of saline stress (50mM and 100mM NaCl) applied singular and in combination with SiO2 on basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) seedlings. Significant changes occurred in terms of shoot length, varying from 7.27 mm (50 mM NaCl) to 8.39 mm (50mM NaCl+SiNPs), and in the case of radicles, from 3.22 mm (SiNP) to 3.98 mm (100 mM NaCl), suggesting that salt treatment reduces shoot elongation, and SiO2 application could mitigate the saline stress effect. The activity of antioxidant enzymes in O. basilicum seedlings exposed to treatments, singular or in combination, was generally lower compared to the control. SiO2 supplement may contribute to the increase of salt tolerance, as reflected by the improvement of SOD and POD activity, especially in the combined treatment of 100 mM NaCl+SiO2.', 'Hybrid electric vehicles are playing very important key role in transportation. As atmospheric imbalance is a cause of large amount of carbon emission due to fuel used in vehicles. So to mitigate this problem use of electric vehicles is increasing day by day. Lithium-ion batteries are playing very crucial role in hybrid electric vehicles. As these batteries are very beneficial for proper functioning of hybrid electric vehicles. So Lithium-ion is the best and most promising choice at the present. Lithium-ion batteries have myriad amount of applications in the field of electric vehicles and portable electronics. The worldwide demand for a clean, low fuel-consuming road transportation system has given raises to the rapid growth of hybrid electric vehicles. Nanotechnology is playing vital role in enhancing the battery life. So use of nanostructure materials in battery design is increasing day by day. This enables battery to become effectual in many applications Lithium- ion batteries (LIBs) are the best choice as they have advantages such as high energy density, high discharge power and long service life. In large scale applications of lithium ion battery important aspects such as safety, toxicity, cost and myriad of raw materials become highly significant and also high discharge rate requirements can be fulfill by the use of nanostructure materials to achieve performance targets. This paper mainly focuses on use of nanotechnology in lithium-ion battery technology. For this purpose system can be designed which is combination of many technology and based on nanotechnology that enables to use nanostructure materials for lithium ion battery used in hybrid electric vehicles. This system is nanotechnology enabled hybrid system which can be very beneficial to ameliorates the performance of the battery that will further helps in ameliorating performance of hybrid electric vehicles. Super capacitors are used in parallel combination in the hybrid system to increases battery performance, efficiency and life of battery this system can play important role in betterment of transportation as well as in enhancing electrification of transportation. Nanostructure materials in batteries ameliorate the electrochemical performances of existing electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries, for this purpose nanotechnology based hybrid system is very beneficial.', 'In light of the widespread adoption of large language models, their susceptibility to security vulnerabilities cannot be overlooked. As a result, it has become imperative to evaluate their proficiency in addressing issues such as toxicity, bias, and disinformation. However, current research focused on appraising and mitigating security risks has predominantly concentrated on specific facets, leading to disparities in evaluation criteria. In contrast, there has been relatively limited attention given to multidimensional and universal frameworks for security evaluation. In this context, this paper delves into the realm of generic evaluation frameworks for security that offer support for cross-language and multi-category analysis. We underscore the existing challenges associated with prominent large language models concerning security issues and develop a comprehensive test data set to furnish researchers with a tool for quantifying security aspects. Through comprehensive evaluations across three major benchmark tests, we identify distinct strengths and weaknesses exhibited by each open source large language model to varying degrees. By employing a multi-dimensional security evaluation framework, we can attain a more holistic comprehension of the performance exhibited by each model across diverse security dimensions. This approach holds significant value in advancing the domain of security research and facilitating the practical application of language models.', 'The Flat Panel Display Industry in Taiwan recently has reached a numerous export value with tens of billion US dollars. It is also a core industry for Taiwan. However, the recent environmental protection strategy and directives developed in Europe, US, and Japan have been gradually shifting from the end of pipe mindset to a more impacts preventive approach from the product designing phase, which was perceived as a new trade barrier that could have significant negative impacts on Taiwan industries. Thus, this paper categorizes the international environmental standards, relative regulations and proposes some strategies of DfE for LCD products in Taiwan. This paper also presented successful cases of DfE application in LCD Monitor, indicated significant benefits could be obtained. For this case, costs reduction around $65,000 US dollars in materials and 2,500 hours saving in labor was achieved every year, and the pollutants emission was also mitigated with rate around 20∼30% estimated. By using saving energy, low toxicity, and recycling concept into development of LCD products, it would improve these products to comply with requirements from international regulations.', 'Microfluidic biochips are recently being advocated for on-chip implementation of several biochemical laboratory assays or protocols [1]. Such labs-on-a-chip (LoC) have brought a complete paradigm shift in DNA analysis, toxicity grading, in molecular biology, and in drug design and delivery. This technology offers a viable and low-cost platform for reducing healthcare cost of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, for providing point-of-care (P-o-C) health services [2, 3], and for the management of bio-terrorism threats [4]. These chips are also immensely useful for rapid and accurate diagnosis of various diseases including malaria, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV), acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and for mitigating neglected tropical diseases (NTD) prevalent in the developing countries [5].', 'In the last years research-based programs relevant to sustainability have been developed. Some technological research programs are focused on the design of systems and processes that can be useful for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions as CO2. To diminish the negative impact caused by CO2 for global warming, its chemical transformation in Dimethyl Carbonate is a promising technology. Dimethyl Carbonate is a solvent with low toxicity and due to oxidative capacity can be used as fuel additive. In this work, the membrane reactor technology to improve the Dymethyl Carbonate production is explored from the perspective of modelling and simulation. As a result, a software-based model is implemented, in order to develop and couple different models for describing the membrane reactor. Simulation results showed that the membrane reactor, compared with conventional reactor, increase the reaction conversion and Dymethyl Carbonate production up to 67% and 78%, respectively. Finally, it can be seen that the solution obtained from software-based model allows to conclude that membrane reactor is a promising technology to mitigate CO2 emissions, allowing to achieve environmental sustainability.', 'The clinical success of targeted cancer therapies is limited by the emergence of drug resistance often due to pre-existing tumor genetic heterogeneity and acquired, therapy-induced resistance. Targeted therapies have varied success in addressing metastatic disease, due to their ability to penetrate certain physiological compartments. This paper considers an evolutionary cancer model that incorporates tumor cell growth, mutation and compartmental migration and leverages recent results on the optimal control of monotone and convex systems to synthesize switching treatment strategies where a single drug or a predetermined combination of drugs is used at a given time. The need for switching is motivated by clinical considerations such as the limited effectiveness of any single targeted therapy against multiple resistance mechanisms arising in a single patient and the inability to design drug combinations at effective doses due to toxicity constraints. An optimal and clinically feasible switching therapy is obtained as the solution of a convex optimization problem that exploits the diagonally-dominant structure of the model. We demonstrate that this method yields an effective strategy in mitigating disease evolution in the presence of imperfect drug penetration in two compartments on an experimentally identified model of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-rearranged lung carcinoma.', 'Recent progress on bioresorbable and bio-compatible miniature systems provides prospects for developing novel nanorobots operating inside the human body. These nanoscale systems are expected to dissolve in vivo and cause no side effect after completing their tasks. Motivated by these advancements, we have developed the analytical framework of touchable molecular communication (TouchCom) to describe the process of direct drug targeting (DDT) using externally controllable nanorobots. Built upon our previous work, we develop a novel latticed channel model of TouchCom for an interconnected capillary network near a targeted tumor area. Specifically, we propose a two-dimensional grid to synthesize the microcirculation environment, which is used to describe the propagation process of nanorobots. Furthermore, by applying the concept of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems in wireless communications to the therapeutic window in cancer treatment, we propose a MIMO DDT strategy in the latticed channel to enhance the targeting efficiency while minimizing the adverse effect of drug toxicity. Based on the proposed model, we study the influence of blood flow direction on the efficiency of DDT, and introduce a compensation strategy with the help of an external guiding field to mitigate the misalignment between the direction of blood flow and the tumor location.', 'Environment indoor quality (EIQ) is a multifaceted problem encompassing a broad range and fluctuation of contaminants that pose risks to human health, satisfaction, welfare, and efficiency, particularly in relation to environment indoor air quality (EIAQ). The presence of indoor air pollutants (IAP) in the environment significantly influences the decline in the quality of human life, owing to the hazards associated with indoor air pollution and discomfort-causing pollutants affecting thermal comfort. This research features a proposed EIAQ monitoring and controlling system based on the environment indoor air quality index (EIAQI) for detecting, identifying, assessing, and controlling air pollutants. Further, it monitors the concentration of the gases and calculate the toxicity level of the environment status index. It also provides the output control system such as ventilation system and alert system to mitigate the air pollutants based on EIAQI automatically. The EIAQ system integrated with IoT technology to provide a monitoring application the entire air pollutant and EIAQI. As a result, the use of the indoor air quality (IAQ) system becomes a suitable method for identifying, categorizing, assessing, offering guidance, and implementing preventive measures to enhance the quality of the environment.', 'Printed electronics allow for ultra-low-cost circuit fabrication with unique properties such as flexibility, non-toxicity, and stretchability. Because of these advanced properties, there is a growing interest in adapting printed electronics for emerging areas such as fast-moving consumer goods and wearable technologies. In such domains, analog signal processing in or near the sensor is favorable. Printed neuromorphic circuits have been recently proposed as a solution to perform such analog processing natively. Additionally, their learning-based design process allows high eﬃciency of their optimization and enables them to mitigate the high process variations associated with low-cost printed processes. In this work, we address the aging of the printed components. This effect can significantly degrade the accuracy of printed neuromorphic circuits over time. For this, we develop a stochastic aging-model to describe the behavior of aged printed resistors and modify the training objective by considering the expected loss over the lifetime of the device. This approach ensures to provide acceptable accuracy over the device lifetime. Our experiments show that an overall 35.8% improvement in terms of expected accuracy over the device lifetime can be achieved using the proposed learning approach.'], 'Keywords': ['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', ''], 'DOI': ['10.1109/ESEM56168.2023.10304855', '', '10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9629924', '10.1109/CIBCB.2017.8058540', '10.1109/ICWCSC.2010.5415880', '10.1109/ICPCSN58827.2023.00017', '10.1109/ISTAS52410.2021.9629201', '10.1109/WSC.2004.1371528', '10.1145/3510458.3513019', '10.1109/SEB-SDG57117.2023.10124489', '10.1093/jrr/rrw093', '10.1109/DODUGC.2003.1253374', '10.1109/IEMBS.2006.260521', '10.1109/EHB52898.2021.9657645', '10.1109/AEEICB.2017.7972378', '10.1109/ICBAIE59714.2023.10281279', '10.1109/ECODIM.2005.1619283', '10.1109/ICCAD.2014.7001364', '10.23919/CISTI.2018.8399195', '10.1109/CDC.2016.7798636', '10.1109/TNB.2019.2943671', '10.1109/ISITIA59021.2023.10221098', ''], 'Authors': ['Sarker, Jaydeb, Sultana, Sayma, Wilson, Steven R., Bosu, Amiangshu', 'Raman, Naveen, Cao, Minxuan, Tsvetkov, Yulia, Kästner, Christian, Vasilescu, Bogdan', 'Posada-Quintero, Hugo F., Derrick, Bruce J., Winstead-Derlega, Christopher, Gonzalez, Sara I., Claire Ellis, M., Freiberger, John J., Chon, Ki H.', 'Kimura, Masataka, Aoki, Shin, Ohwada, Hayato', 'Kumar, P.T.Krishna, Vinod, P.T., Madhusudana, Suhas, Iyengar, S.S.', 'Jadhav, Ranjana, Agarwal, Naman, Shevate, Srushti, Sawakare, Chinmayee, Parakh, Piyush, Khandare, Snehankit', 'Faal, Farshid, Schmitt, Ketra, Yu, Jia Yuan', 'Sepulveda, J., Rabelo, L., Park, J., Gruber, F., Martinez, O.', 'Qiu, Huilian Sophie, Vasilescu, Bogdan, Kästner, Christian, Egelman, Carolyn, Jaspan, Ciera, Murphy-Hill, Emerson', 'Oluwafemi, Adekemi Grace, Ajayi, Olubunmi Bolanle, Amarachi, Acho Marvellous, Emmanuel, Damilare Rotimi, Omoniwa, Babasoji Percy', 'Chacko, Tiju, Menon, Aditya, Majeed, Teeju, Nair, Sivaprabha V., John, Nithu Sara, Nair, Cherupally Krishnan Krishnan', 'Hurley, M.M., Wright, J.B., Balboa, A., Lushington, G.H.', 'Johnson, Matthew D., Langhals, Nicholas B., Kipke, Daryl R.', 'Oprica, Lacramioara, Grigore, Marius-Nicusor, Bara, Iulia, Vochita, Gabriela', 'Deshpande, Vaibhav S., Talele, Mohit N.', 'Yu, Zhiyin', 'Lin, Ching-Chih, Chung, Mei-Hwa, Wang, Zen', 'Chakrabarty, Krishnendu, Bhattacharya, Bhargab B., Banerjee, Ansuman', 'Moncada, Sebastian Villegas, Palacio, Mauricio Gonzalez, Luna-delRisco, Mario, Orozco, Carlos Andres Arredondo, Jair, Jhon, Montealegre, Quiza, Imbachi, Jenny Cuantindoy, Diaz-Forero, Isabel', 'Giordano, Giulia, Rantzer, Anders, Jonsson, Vanessa D.', 'Zhou, Yu, Chen, Yifan', 'Dionova, Brainvendra Widi, Hendrawati, Dwiana, Abdulrazaq, Mohammed N., Vresdian, Devan Junesco, Hapsari, Anindya Ananda, Abdullah, Muhammad Irsyad, Pratama, Legenda Prameswono', 'Zhao, Haibin, Hefenbrock, Michael, Beigl, Michael, Tahoori, Mehdi B.']}\n"
