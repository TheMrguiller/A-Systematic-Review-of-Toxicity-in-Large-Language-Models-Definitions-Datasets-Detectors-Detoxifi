**Abstract**Annotators' sociodemographic backgrounds (i.e., the individual compositions of their gender, age, educational background, etc.) have a strong impact on their decisions when working on subjective NLP tasks, such as toxic language detection. Often, heterogeneous backgrounds result in high disagreements. To model this variation, recent work has explored sociodemographic prompting, a technique, which steers the output of prompt-based models towards answers that humans with specific sociodemographic profiles would give. However, the available NLP literature disagrees on the efficacy of this technique - it remains unclear for which tasks and scenarios it can help, and the role of the individual factors in sociodemographic prompting is still unexplored. We address this research gap by presenting the largest and most comprehensive study of sociodemographic prompting today. We analyze its influence on model sensitivity, performance and robustness across seven datasets and six instruction-tuned model families. We show that sociodemographic information affects model predictions and can be beneficial for improving zero-shot learning in subjective NLP tasks. However, its outcomes largely vary for different model types, sizes, and datasets, and are subject to large variance with regards to prompt formulations. Most importantly, our results show that sociodemographic prompting should be used with care for sensitive applications, such as toxicity annotation or when studying LLM alignment.","Beck, Tilman; Schuff, Hendrik; Lauscher, Anne; Gurevych, Iryna",,,"Sensitivity, Performance, Robustness: Deconstructing the Effect of Sociodemographic Prompting",,, ,Proceedings Paper ,,"Annotators' sociodemographic backgrounds (i.e., the individual compositions of their gender, age, educational background, etc.) have a strong impact on their decisions when working on subjective NLP tasks, such as toxic language detection.

**Abstract**Recent Query Auto-completion (QAC) systems leverage natural language generation or pre-trained language models (PLMs) to demonstrate remarkable performance. However, these systems also suffer from biased and toxic completions. Efforts have been made to address language detoxification within PLMs using controllable text generation (CTG) techniques, involving training with nontoxic data and employing decoding time approaches. As the completions for QAC systems are usually short, these existing CTG methods based on decoding and training are not directly transferable. Towards these concerns, we propose the first public QAC detoxification model, Detoxifying Query Auto-Completion (or DQAC), which utilizes adapters in a CTG framework. DQAC operates on latent representations with no additional overhead. It leverages two adapters for toxic and non-toxic cases. During inference, we fuse these representations in a controlled manner that guides the generation of query completions towards nontoxicity. We evaluate toxicity levels in the generated completions across two realworld datasets using two classifiers: a publicly available (Detoxify) and a search query-specific classifier which we develop (QDETOXIFY). DQAC consistently outperforms all existing baselines and emerges as a state-of-the-art model providing high quality and low toxicity.

**Abstract**Transformer-based Language Models (LMs) have achieved impressive results on natural language understanding tasks, but they can also generate toxic text such as insults, threats, and profanity, limiting their real-world applications. To overcome this issue, a few text generation approaches aim to detoxify toxic texts using additional LMs or perturbations. However, previous methods require excessive memory, computations, and time which are serious bottlenecks in their real-world application. To address such limitations, we propose an effective yet efficient method for language detoxification using an attribute-discriminative latent space. Specifically, we project the latent space of an original Transformer LM onto a discriminative latent space that well-separates texts by their attributes using a projection block and an attribute discriminator. This allows the LM to control the text generation to be nontoxic with minimal memory and computation overhead. We validate our model, Attribute-Discriminative Language Model (ADLM) on detoxified language and dialogue generation tasks, on which our method significantly outperforms baselines both in performance and efficiency.","Kwak, Jin Myung; Kim, Minseon; Hwang, Sung Ju","Hwang, Sung/A-8817-2018",,Language Detoxification with Attribute-Discriminative Latent Space,,, ,Proceedings Paper ,,"Transformer-based Language Models (LMs) have achieved impressive results on natural language understanding tasks, but they can also generate toxic text such as insults, threats, and profanity, limiting their real-world applications.

**Abstract**Modern Query Auto-Completion (QAC) systems utilize natural language generation (NLG) using large language models (LLM) to achieve remarkable performance. However, these systems are prone to generating biased and toxic completions due to inherent learning biases. Existing detoxification approaches exhibit two key limitations: (1) They primarily focus on mitigating toxicity for grammatically well-formed long sentences but struggle to adapt to the QAC task, where queries are short and structurally different (include spelling errors, do not follow grammatical rules and have relatively flexible word order). (2) These approaches often view detoxification through a binary lens where all text labeled as toxic is undesirable, and non-toxic is considered desirable. To address these limitations, we propose DAC, an intuitive and efficient reinforcement learning-based model to detoxify QAC. With DAC, we introduce an additional perspective of considering the third query class of addressable toxicity. These queries can encompass implicit toxicity, subjective toxicity, or non-toxic queries containing toxic words. We incorporate this three-class query behavior perspective into the proposed model through quantized optimal transport to learn distinctions and generate truly non-toxic completions. We evaluate toxicity levels in the generated completions by DAC across two real-world QAC datasets (Bing and AOL) using two classifiers: a publicly available generic classifier (Detoxify) and a search queryspecific classifier, which we develop (TClassify).

**Abstract**One of the main challenges open-domain end-to-end dialogue systems, or chatbots, face is the prevalence of unsafe behavior, such as toxic languages and harmful suggestions. However, existing dialogue datasets do not provide enough annotation to explain and correct such unsafe behavior. In this work, we construct a new dataset called SAFECONV for the research of conversational safety: (1) Besides the utterance-level safety labels, SAFECONV also provides unsafe spans in an utterance, information able to indicate which words contribute to the detected unsafe behavior; (2) SAFECONV provides safe alternative responses to continue the conversation when unsafe behavior detected, guiding the conversation to a gentle trajectory. By virtue of the comprehensive annotation of SAFECONV, we benchmark three powerful models for the mitigation of conversational unsafe behavior, including a checker to detect unsafe utterances, a tagger to extract unsafe spans, and a rewriter to convert an unsafe response to a safe version. Moreover, we explore the huge benefits brought by combining the models for explaining the emergence of unsafe behavior and detoxifying chatbots. Experiments show that the detected unsafe behavior could be well explained with unsafe spans and popular chatbots could be detoxified by a huge extent.

**Abstract**We set out to explore the unintended effects of human-machine moderation in mitigating harassment within online communities. We examine communities that use a block-list type bot to prevent harassment from the source of harassment. Drawing from social categorization and selective exposure theories, we theorize that employing a machine alongside humans for community moderation will create unintended adverse effects. Specifically, within the moderated focal community, we hypothesize an emboldening effect characterized by an increase in harassment among community members directed at their outgroup members. Additionally, we expect a disengaging effect, that is, a downward trend in the focal community's membership. Finally, in neighboring communities that share the same topic of discussion, we expect a spillover effect, that is, an increase in harassment. Employing Detoxify, a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)-based model, we evaluate harassment scores in the focal community by analyzing 4 million Reddit comments across various communities. These scores serve as inputs for Bayesian Structural Time Series analysis, revealing evidence for both disengaging and spillover effects. For the emboldening effect, we use community-specific keywords in a predefined computer-assisted document classification approach, Keyword Assisted Topic Model (keyATM), to identify the target of harassment. We use mean comparison and regression discontinuity to assess the change in the level of harassment targeting outgroup members before and after the human-machine moderation implementation.","Nguyen, An; Rai, Arun; Maruping, Likoebe",,"Nguyen, An/0009-0008-4292-5964; Rai, Arun/0000-0002-3655-7543; Maruping, Likoebe/0000-0001-5105-6635",Understanding the Unintended Effects of Human-Machine Moderation in Addressing Harassment within Online Communities,41,2.0,10.1080/07421222.2024.2340831 ,Article ,,"We set out to explore the unintended effects of human-machine moderation in mitigating harassment within online communities.

**Abstract**Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, their practical usability is often compromised by a propensity to generate toxic content, such as insults, threats, and profanity, particularly in response to adversarial prompts. Several fine-tuning and decoding approaches have been employed to address this challenge to mitigate toxicity. Nevertheless, these methods typically necessitate additional resources, such as high-quality training data or auxiliary models, thereby incurring extra costs. In this paper, we propose a novel detoxification framework, Fine-Grained Detoxification via Instance-Level Prefixes (FGDILP), which effectively mitigates the generation of toxic text without incurring additional training costs. Specifically, FGDILP leverages contextualized representations in attention space by contrasting a positive prefix-prepended prompt against multiple negative prefix-prepended prompts at the instance level. This methodology facilitates the construction of fine-grained subtoxicity vectors, which are subsequently fused to adjust the original generation pathway when responding to raw prompts. Our results demonstrate that FGDILP enables controlled text generation concerning detoxification at both the utterance and context levels.

**Abstract**Background: Toxicity on social media, encompassing behaviors such as harassment, bullying, hate speech, and the dissemination of misinformation, has become a pressing social concern in the digital age. Its prevalence intensifies during periods of social crises and unrest, eroding a sense of safety and community. Such toxic environments can adversely impact the mental well-being of those exposed and further deepen societal divisions and polarization. The 2022 mpox outbreak, initially called monkeypox but later renamed to reduce stigma and address societal concerns, provides a relevant context for this issue. Objective: In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the toxic online discourse surrounding the 2022 mpox outbreak. We aimed to dissect its origins, characterize its nature and content, trace its dissemination patterns, and assess its broader societal implications, with the goal of providing insights that can inform strategies to mitigate such toxicity in future crises. Methods: We collected >1.6 million unique tweets and analyzed them with 5 dimensions: context, extent, content, speaker, and intent. Using topic modeling based on bidirectional encoder representations from transformers and social network community clustering, we delineated the toxic dynamics on Twitter. Results: By categorizing topics, we identified 5 high-level categories in the toxic online discourse on Twitter, including disease (20,281/43,521, 46.6%), health policy and health care (8400/43,521, 19.3%), homophobia (10,402/43,521, 23.9%), politics (2611/43,521, 6%), and racism (1784/43,521, 4.1%). Across these categories, users displayed negativity or controversial views on the mpox outbreak, highlighting the escalating political tensions and the weaponization of stigma during this infodemic. Through the toxicity diffusion networks of mentions (17,437 vertices with 3628 clusters), retweets (59,749 vertices with 3015 clusters), and the top users with the highest in-degree centrality, we found that retweets of toxic content were widespread, while influential users rarely engaged with or countered this toxicity through retweets.

Its prevalence intensifies during periods of social crises and unrest, eroding a sense of safety and community. Such toxic environments can adversely impact the mental well-being of those exposed and further deepen societal divisions and polarization. The 2022 mpox outbreak, initially called monkeypox but later renamed to reduce stigma and address societal concerns, provides a relevant context for this issue. Objective: In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the toxic online discourse surrounding the 2022 mpox outbreak. We aimed to dissect its origins, characterize its nature and content, trace its dissemination patterns, and assess its broader societal implications, with the goal of providing insights that can inform strategies to mitigate such toxicity in future crises. Methods: We collected >1.6 million unique tweets and analyzed them with 5 dimensions: context, extent, content, speaker, and intent. Using topic modeling based on bidirectional encoder representations from transformers and social network community clustering, we delineated the toxic dynamics on Twitter. Results: By categorizing topics, we identified 5 high-level categories in the toxic online discourse on Twitter, including disease (20,281/43,521, 46.6%), health policy and health care (8400/43,521, 19.3%), homophobia (10,402/43,521, 23.9%), politics (2611/43,521, 6%), and racism (1784/43,521, 4.1%). Across these categories, users displayed negativity or controversial views on the mpox outbreak, highlighting the escalating political tensions and the weaponization of stigma during this infodemic. Through the toxicity diffusion networks of mentions (17,437 vertices with 3628 clusters), retweets (59,749 vertices with 3015 clusters), and the top users with the highest in-degree centrality, we found that retweets of toxic content were widespread, while influential users rarely engaged with or countered this toxicity through retweets. Conclusions: Our study introduces a comprehensive workflow that combines topical and network analyses to decode emerging social issues during crises. By tracking topical dynamics, we can track the changing popularity of toxic content on the internet, providing a better understanding of societal challenges.

**Abstract**Online communication platforms have revolutionized interpersonal interactions by transcending geographical barriers. While facilitating connectivity, these platforms have introduced challenges such as overcoming linguistic differences and preventing spam and offensive content diffusion. This is particularly pertinent in the context of deliberative events, where online platforms could be used to extend the inclusion of citizens in democratic decision-making. In traditional deliberative events, human moderators and translators were used to facilitate conversation; however, the need for these figures imposed a limit on both the number of deliberative events that could be organized and the number of participants. In response, this paper proposes an automated moderator for deliberative events. The moderator is developed in Python for the online communication platform Discord and can be used, thanks to the integrated AI (Artificial Intelligence) tools, to automatically manage conversation agendas, prevent spam and inappropriate language, analyze the sentiment of the conversation, and translate messages into multiple languages. In particular, three classifiers, based on a pre-trained BERT (Bidirection Encoder Representations from Transformers), were fine-tuned for spam detection, toxic comments classification, and sentiment analysis. These allow the moderator to automatically detect and remove spam and offensive messages in different languages, send warnings to users, alert administrators, and, after repeated warnings, impose bans. Additionally, a built-in translator, based on Meta's No Language Left Behind NLLB model, translates messages into five languages (Italian, English, French, German, and Polish).

Moreover, the web is a highly multilingual, cross-cultural community that develops its own lingo over time.

We demonstrate that by forgoing static vocabularies, we gain flexibility across a variety of settings. We additionally outline the techniques employed to make such a byte-level model efficient and feasible for productionization. Through extensive experiments on multilingual toxic comment classification benchmarks derived from real API traffic and evaluation on an array of code-switching, covert toxicity, emoji-based hate, human-readable obfuscation, distribution shift, and bias evaluation settings, we show that our proposed approach outperforms strong baselines.

**Abstract**Many text classification tasks are inherently ambiguous, which results in automatic systems having a high risk of making mistakes, in spite of using advanced machine learning models. For example, toxicity detection in user-generated content is a subjective task, and notions of toxicity can be annotated according to a variety of definitions that can be in conflict with one another. Instead of relying solely on automatic solutions, moderation of the most difficult and ambiguous cases can be delegated to human workers. Potential mistakes in automated classification can be identified by using uncertainty estimation (UE) techniques. Although UE is a rapidly growing field within natural language processing, we find that state-of-the-art UE methods estimate only epistemic uncertainty and show poor performance, or under-perform trivial methods for ambiguous tasks such as toxicity detection. We argue that in order to create robust uncertainty estimation methods for ambiguous tasks it is necessary to account also for aleatoric uncertainty.

2497,"**Title**A Wide Evaluation of ChatGPT on Affective Computing Tasks

**Abstract**With the rise of foundation models, a new artificial intelligence paradigm has emerged, by simply using general purpose foundation models with prompting to solve problems instead of training a separate machine learning model for each problem. Such models have been shown to have emergent properties of solving problems that they were not initially trained on. The studies for the effectiveness of such models are still quite limited. In this work, we widely study the capabilities of the ChatGPT models, namely GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, on 13 affective computing problems, namely aspect extraction, aspect polarity classification, opinion extraction, sentiment analysis, sentiment intensity ranking, emotions intensity ranking, suicide tendency detection, toxicity detection, well-being assessment, engagement measurement, personality assessment, sarcasm detection, and subjectivity detection. We introduce a framework to evaluate the ChatGPT models on regression-based problems, such as intensity ranking problems, by modelling them as pairwise ranking classification.

**Abstract**Designing a query-efficient attack strategy to generate high-quality adversarial examples under the hard-label black-box setting is a fundamental yet challenging problem, especially in natural language processing (NLP). The process of searching for adversarial examples has many uncertainties (e.g., an unknown impact on the target model's prediction of the added perturbation) when confidence scores cannot be accessed, which must be compensated for with a large number of queries. To address this issue, we propose TextCheater, a decision-based metaheuristic search method that performs a query-efficient textual adversarial attack task by prohibiting invalid searches. The strategies of multiple initialization points and Tabu search are also introduced to keep the search process from falling into a local optimum. We apply our approach to three state-of-the-art language models (i.e., BERT, wordLSTM, and wordCNN) across six benchmark datasets and eight real-world commercial sentiment analysis platforms/models. Furthermore, we evaluate the Robustly optimized BERT pretraining Approach (RoBERTa) and models that enhance their robustness by adversarial training on toxicity detection and text classification tasks. The results demonstrate that our method minimizes the number of queries required for crafting plausible adversarial text while outperforming existing attack methods in the attack success rate, fluency of output sentences, and similarity between the original text and its adversary.","Peng, Hao; Guo, Shixin; Zhao, Dandan; Zhang, Xuhong; Han, Jianmin; Ji, Shouling; Yang, Xing; Zhong, Ming","Zhong, Ming/AHC-9485-2022; peng, hao/C-2042-2016; Yang, Xing/HHS-6130-2022","peng, hao/0000-0003-0586-7132; Zhong, Ming/0000-0002-9132-3782; zhao, dandan/0000-0001-9375-2997; Guo, Shixin/0009-0003-1763-5221; Yang, Xing/0000-0002-8824-1356",TextCheater: A Query-Efficient Textual Adversarial Attack in the Hard-Label Setting,21,4.0,10.1109/TDSC.2023.3339802 ,Article ,,"Designing a query-efficient attack strategy to generate high-quality adversarial examples under the hard-label black-box setting is a fundamental yet challenging problem, especially in natural language processing (NLP).

**Abstract**Large language models produce human-like text that drives a growing number of applications. However, recent literature and, increasingly, real world observations, have demonstrated that these models can generate language that is toxic, biased, untruthful or otherwise harmful. Though work to evaluate language model harms is under way, translating foresight about which harms may arise into rigorous benchmarks is not straightforward. To facilitate this translation, we outline six ways of characterizing harmful text which merit explicit consideration when designing new benchmarks.

**Abstract**Pretrained neural language models (LMs) are prone to generating racist, sexist, or otherwise toxic language which hinders their safe deployment. We investigate the extent to which pretrained LMs can be prompted to generate toxic language, and the effectiveness of controllable text generation algorithms at preventing such toxic degeneration. We create and release REALTOXICITYPROMPTS, a dataset of 100K naturally occurring, sentence-level prompts derived from a large corpus of English web text, paired with toxicity scores from a widely-used toxicity classifier. Using REALTOXICITYPROMPTS, we find that pretrained LMs can degenerate into toxic text even from seemingly innocuous prompts. We empirically assess several controllable generation methods, and find that while data- or compute-intensive methods (e.g., adaptive pretraining on non-toxic data) are more effective at steering away from toxicity than simpler solutions (e.g., banning bad words), no current method is failsafe against neural toxic degeneration. To pinpoint the potential cause of such persistent toxic degeneration, we analyze two web text corpora used to pretrain several LMs (including GPT-2; Radford et al., 2019), and find a significant amount of offensive, factually unreliable, and otherwise toxic content. Our work provides a test bed for evaluating toxic generations by LMs and stresses the need for better data selection processes for pretraining.","Gehman, Samuel; Gururangan, Suchin; Sap, Maarten; Choi, Yejin; Smith, Noah A.",,,REALTOXICITYPROMPTS: Evaluating Neural Toxic Degeneration in Language Models,,, ,Proceedings Paper ,,"Pretrained neural language models (LMs) are prone to generating racist, sexist, or otherwise toxic language which hinders their safe deployment.

**Abstract**Over the past few years, machine learning models have significantly increased in size and complexity, especially in the area of generative AI such as large language models.

**Abstract**While large-scale language models (LMs) are able to imitate the distribution of natural language well enough to generate realistic text, it is difficult to control which regions of the distribution they generate. This is especially problematic because datasets used for training large LMs usually contain significant toxicity, hate, bias, and negativity. One promising approach to address this is to use discriminators to guide decoding from LMs, but existing methods for this are too slow to be useful in practice for many applications. We present GeDi as a significantly more efficient discriminator-based approach for guiding decoding. GeDi guides generation at each step by computing classification probabilities for all possible next tokens via Bayes rule by normalizing over two class-conditional distributions; one conditioned on the desired attribute, or control code, and another conditioned on the undesired attribute, or anti control code. We find that GeDi gives controllability on par with or better than previous controllable generation methods. GeDi results in significantly faster generation speeds than the only previous method that achieved comparable controllability in our experiments. We also show that GeDi can make GPT-2 and GPT-3 significantly less toxic while maintaining linguistic fluency, without sacrificing significantly on generation speed.

**Abstract**Language models (LMs) often exhibit undesirable text generation behaviors, including generating false, toxic, or irrelevant outputs. Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)-where human preference judgments on LM outputs are transformed into a learning signal-has recently shown promise in addressing these issues. However, such holistic feedback conveys limited information on long text outputs; it does not indicate which aspects of the outputs influenced user preference; e.g., which parts contain what type(s) of errors. In this paper, we use fine-grained human feedback (e.g., which sentence is false, which sub-sentence is irrelevant) as an explicit training signal. We introduce FINE-GRAINED RLHF, a framework that enables training and learning from reward functions that are fine-grained in two respects: (1) density, providing a reward after every segment (e.g., a sentence) is generated; and (2) incorporating multiple reward models associated with different feedback types (e.g., factual incorrectness, irrelevance, and information incompleteness). We conduct experiments on detoxification and long-form question answering to illustrate how learning with such reward functions leads to improved performance, supported by both automatic and human evaluation.

**Abstract**Text style transfer aims to rephrase a sentence to match the desired style while retaining the original content. As a controllable text generation task, mainstream approaches use content-independent style embedding as control variables to guide stylistic generation. Nonetheless, stylistic properties are context-sensitive even under the same style. For example, delicious and helpful convey positive sentiments, although they are more likely to describe food and people, respectively. Therefore, desired style signals must vary with the content. To this end, we propose a memory-enhanced transfer method, which learns fine-grained style representation concerning content to assist transfer. Rather than employing static style embedding or latent variables, our method abstracts linguistic characteristics from training corpora and memorizes subdivided content with the corresponding style representations. The style signal is dynamically retrieved from memory using the content as a query, providing a more expressive and flexible latent style space. To address the imbalance between quantity and quality in different content, we further introduce a calibration method to augment memory construction by modeling the relationship between candidate styles. Experimental results obtained using three benchmark datasets confirm the superior performance of our model compared to competitive approaches. The evaluation metrics and case study also indicate that our model can generate diverse stylistic phrases matching context.","Lin, Fuqiang; Song, Yiping; Tian, Zhiliang; Chen, Wangqun; Dong, Diwen; Liu, Bo",,,Memory-enhanced text style transfer with dynamic style learning and calibration,67,4.0,10.1007/s11432-022-3726-0 ,Article ,,"Text style transfer aims to rephrase a sentence to match the desired style while retaining the original content.

To further improve the application of sentiment analysis, there have been two recommendations: Using pre-trained transformer models to classify sentiment and replacing non-natural language elements with meta-tokens. In this work, we benchmark five different sentiment analysis tools (two pre-trained transformer models and three machine learning tools) on 2 gold-standard sentiment analysis datasets. We find that pre-trained transformers outperform the best machine learning tool on only one of the two datasets, and that even on that dataset the performance difference is a few percentage points. Therefore, we recommend that software engineering researchers should not just consider predictive performance when selecting a sentiment analysis tool because the best-performing sentiment analysis tools perform very similarly to each other (within 4 percentage points).

**Abstract**Identifying types of online users' toxic behavior reveals important insights from social media interactions, including whether a user becomes radicalized (more toxic) or pacified (less toxic) over time. In this research, we design two metrics to identify toxic user types: F score that captures the changes in a user's toxicity, and G score that captures the direction of the shift taking place in the user's toxicity pattern. We apply these metrics to a dataset of 4M user comments from Reddit by defining four toxic user types based on the toxicity scores of a user's comments: (a) Steady Users whose toxicity scores are steady over time, (b) Fickle-Minded Users that switch between toxic and non-toxic commenting, (c) Pacified Users whose commenting becomes less toxic in time, and (d) Radicalized Users that become gradually toxic. Findings from the Reddit dataset indicate that fickle-minded users form the largest group (31.2%), followed by pacified (25.8%), radicalized (25.4%), and steadily toxic users (17.6%). The results suggest that the most typical behavior type of toxicity is switching between toxic and non-toxic commenting. This research has implications for preserving the user-friendliness of online communities by identifying continuously toxic users and users in danger of becoming radicalized (in terms of their toxic behavior), and designing interventions to mitigate these behavior types. Using the metrics we have defined, identifying these user types becomes possible. More research is needed to understand why these patterns take place and how they could be mitigated.","Mall, Raghvendra; Nagpal, Mridul; Salminen, Joni; Almerekhi, Hind; Jung, Soon-gyo; Jansen, Bernard J.","Almerekhi, Hind/ITU-8218-2023; Mall, Raghvendra/M-7132-2013",,Four Types of Toxic People: Characterizing Online Users' Toxicity over Time,,,10.1145/3419249.3420142 ,Proceedings Paper ,,"Identifying types of online users' toxic behavior reveals important insights from social media interactions, including whether a user becomes radicalized (more toxic) or pacified (less toxic) over time.

The results suggest that the most typical behavior type of toxicity is switching between toxic and non-toxic commenting. This research has implications for preserving the user-friendliness of online communities by identifying continuously toxic users and users in danger of becoming radicalized (in terms of their toxic behavior), and designing interventions to mitigate these behavior types. Using the metrics we have defined, identifying these user types becomes possible. More research is needed to understand why these patterns take place and how they could be mitigated.",,,978-1-4503-7579-5,, , 11th Nordic Conference on Human-Computer Interaction (NordiCHI)11th Nordic Conference on Human-Computer Interaction (NordiCHI) ,,detection#methodology,

**Abstract**Toxicity is pervasive in online multiplayer games, exposing players to disruptive and harmful behaviours. Players employ various approaches to cope with exposure to toxicity; however, game designers and researchers lack guidance on how to implement coping support within games. In this paper, we first conduct a formative study to collect a comprehensive list of coping approaches from toxicity literature and use affinity mapping to identify overarching game-based coping strategies. Then, we report findings from a survey (n = 85) on players' experiences with toxicity, how they employ the identified coping strategies, how games support coping, and their general coping styles. Our paper contributes a framework for coping strategies to deal with game-based toxicity and provides insights into the prevalence of these strategies among players and factors that affect their usage and effectiveness. These findings can be used to guide better in-game tools that help players mitigate the harm caused by toxicity.","Frommel, Julian; Mandryk, Regan L.","Frommel, Julian/JVM-8038-2024; Mandryk, Regan/HZK-7531-2023",,Toxicity in Online Games: The Prevalence and Eficacy of Coping Strategies,,,10.1145/3613904.3642523 ,Proceedings Paper ,,"Toxicity is pervasive in online multiplayer games, exposing players to disruptive and harmful behaviours.

**Abstract**The spread of hate speech on social media platforms has become a rising concern in recent years. Understanding the spread of hate is crucial for mitigating its harmful effects and fostering a healthier online environment. In this paper, we propose a new model to capture the evolution of toxicity in a network - if a tweet with a certain toxicity (hatefulness) is posted, how much toxic a social network will become after a given number of rounds. We compute a toxicity score for each tweet, indicating the extent of the hatefulness of that tweet.Toxicity spread has not been adequately addressed in the existing literature. The two popular paradigms for modelling information spread, namely the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) and its variants, as well as the spreading-activation models (SPA), are not suitable for modelling toxicity spread. The first paradigm employs a threshold and categorizes tweets as either toxic or non-toxic, while the second paradigm treats hate as energy and applies energy-conversion principles to model its propagation. Through analysis of a Twitter dataset consisting of 19.58 million tweets, we observe that the total toxicity, as well as the average toxicity of original tweets and retweets in the network, does not remain constant but rather increases over time.In this paper, we propose a new method for toxicity spread. First, we categorize users into three distinct groups: Amplifiers, Attenuators, and Copycats. These categories are assigned based on the exchange of toxicity by a user, with Amplifiers sending out more toxicity than they receive, Attenuators experiencing a higher influx of toxicity compared to what they generate, and Copycats simply mirroring the hate they receive. We perform extensive experimentation on Barabasi-Albert (BA) graphs, as well as subgraphs extracted from the Twitter dataset.

**Abstract**Online sexism is a pervasive problem with a significant impact on the targeted individuals and social inequalities. Automated tools are now widely used to identify sexist content at scale, but most of these tools do not provide any further explanations beyond generic categories such as 'toxicity', 'abuse' or 'sexism'. This paper explores the impact of hallucination reduction in LLMs on enhancing sexism detection across three different levels: binary sexism, four-categories of sexism, and fine-grained vectors, with a focus on explainability in sexism detection. We have successfully applied Neural Path Hunter (NPH) to GPT-2, with the purpose of teaching the model to hallucinate less. We have used hallucination-reduced GPT-2, achieving accuracy rates of 83.2% for binary detection, 52.2% for four-categories classification and 38.0% for the 11-vectors fine-grained classification, respectively.

**Abstract**A hostile or aggressive behavior on an online platform by an individual or a group of people is termed as cyberbullying. A bystander is the one who sees or knows about such incidences of cyberbullying. A defender who intervenes can mitigate the impact of bullying, an instigator who accomplices the bully, can add to the victim's suffering, and an impartial onlooker who remains neutral and observes the scenario without getting engaged. Studying the behavior of Bystanders role can help in shaping the scale and progression of bullying incidents. However, the lack of data hinders the research in this area. Recently, a dataset, CYBY23, of Twitter threads having main tweets and the replies of Bystanders was published on Kaggle in Oct 2023. The dataset has extracted features related to toxicity and sensitivity of the main tweets and reply tweets. The authors have got manual annotators to assign the labels of Bystanders' roles. Manually labeling bystanders' roles is a labor-intensive task which eventually raises the need to have an automatic labeling technique for identifying the Bystander role. In this work, we aim to suggest a machine-learning model with high efficiency for the automatic labeling of Bystanders. Initially, the dataset was re-sampled using SMOTE to make it a balanced dataset. Next, we experimented with 12 models using various feature engineering techniques. Best features were selected for further experimentation by removing highly correlated and less relevant features. The models were evaluated on the metrics of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. We found that the Random Forest Classifier (RFC) model with a certain set of features is the highest scorer among all 12 models.

**Abstract**Web-based content analysis tasks, such as labeling toxicity, misinformation, or spam often rely on machine learning models to achieve cost and scale efficiencies. As these models impact real human lives, ensuring accuracy and fairness of such models is critical. However, maintaining the performance of these models over time can be challenging due to the temporal shifts in the application context and the sub-populations represented. Furthermore, there is often a delay in obtaining human expert labels for the raw data, which hinders the timely adaptation and safe deployment of the models. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach that anticipates future distributions of data, especially in settings where unlabeled data becomes available earlier than the labels to estimate the future distribution of labels per sub-population and adapt the model preemptively. We evaluate our approach using multiple temporally-shifting datasets and consider bias based on racial, political, and demographic identities.

2680,"**Title**Persistent interaction patterns across social media platforms and over time

**Abstract**Growing concern surrounds the impact of social media platforms on public discourse(1-4) and their influence on social dynamics(5-9), especially in the context of toxicity(10-12). Here, to better understand these phenomena, we use a comparative approach to isolate human behavioural patterns across multiple social media platforms. In particular, we analyse conversations in different online communities, focusing on identifying consistent patterns of toxic content. Drawing from an extensive dataset that spans eight platforms over 34 years-from Usenet to contemporary social media-our findings show consistent conversation patterns and user behaviour, irrespective of the platform, topic or time.

**Abstract**Social media platforms, online news commenting spaces, and many other public forums have become widely known for issues of abusive behavior such as cyber-bullying and personal attacks. In this paper, we use the annotated tweets of Offensive Language Identification Dataset (OLID) to train three levels of deep learning classifiers to solve the three sub-tasks associated with the dataset. Sub-task A is to determine if the tweet is toxic or not. Then, for offensive tweets, sub-task B requires determining whether the toxicity is targeted. Finally, for sub-task C, we predict the target of the offense; i.e. a group, individual or other entity. In our solution, we tackle the problem of class imbalance in the dataset by using back translation for data augmentation and utilizing fine-tuned BERT model in an ensemble of deep learning classifiers. We used this solution to participate in the three English sub-tasks of SemEval-2020 task 12.

**Abstract**To address the problem of NLP classifiers learning spurious correlations between training features and target labels, a common approach is to make the model's predictions invariant to these features. However, this can be counterproductive when the features have a non-zero causal effect on the target label and thus are important for prediction. Therefore, using methods from the causal inference literature, we propose an algorithm to regularize the learnt effect of the features on the model's prediction to the estimated effect of feature on label. This results in an automated augmentation method that leverages the estimated effect of a feature to appropriately change the labels for new augmented inputs. On toxicity and IMDB review datasets, the proposed algorithm minimises spurious correlations and improves the minority group (i.e., samples breaking spurious correlations) accuracy, while also improving the total accuracy compared to standard training.

**Abstract**A substantial portion of offensive content on social media is directed towards women. Since the approaches for general offensive content detection face a challenge in detecting misogynistic content, it requires solutions tailored to address offensive content against women. To this end, we propose a novel multimodal framework for the detection of misogynistic and sexist content. The framework comprises three modules: the Multimodal Attention module (MANM), the Graph-based Feature Reconstruction Module (GFRM), and the Content-specific Features Learning Module (CFLM). The MANM employs adaptive gating-based multimodal context-aware attention, enabling the model to focus on relevant visual and textual information and generating contextually relevant features. The GFRM module utilizes graphs to refine features within individual modalities, while the CFLM focuses on learning text and image-specific features such as toxicity features and caption features. Additionally, we curate a set of misogynous lexicons to compute the misogyny-specific lexicon score from the text. We apply test-time augmentation in feature space to better generalize the predictions on diverse inputs. The performance of the proposed approach has been evaluated on two multimodal datasets, MAMI, and MMHS150K, with 11,000 and 13,494 samples, respectively.

**Abstract**Toxic content detection is crucial for online services to remove inappropriate content that violates community standards. To automate the detection process, prior works have proposed varieties of machine learning (ML) approaches to train Language Models (LMs) for toxic content detection. However, both their accuracy and transferability across datasets are limited. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in toxic content detection due to their superior zero-shot and few-shot in-context learning ability as well as broad transferability on ML tasks. However, efficiently designing prompts for LLMs remains challenging. Moreover, the high run-time cost of LLMs may hinder their deployments in production. To address these challenges, in this work, we propose BD-LLM, a novel and efficient approach to Bootstrapping and Distilling LLMs for toxic content detection. Specifically, we design a novel prompting method named Decision-Tree-of-Thought (DToT) to bootstrap LLMs' detection performance and extract high-quality rationales. DToT can automatically select more fine-grained context to re-prompt LLMs when their responses lack confidence. Additionally, we use the rationales extracted via DToT to fine-tune student LMs. Our experimental results on various datasets demonstrate that DToT can improve the accuracy of LLMs by up to 4.6%. Furthermore, student LMs fine-tuned with rationales extracted via DToT outperform baselines on all datasets with up to 16.9% accuracy improvement, while being more than 60x smaller than conventional LLMs. Finally, we observe that student LMs fine-tuned with rationales exhibit better cross-dataset transferability.","Zhang, Jiang; Wu, Qiong; Xu, Yiming; Cao, Cheng; Du, Zheng; Psounis, Konstantinos",,,Efficient Toxic Content Detection by Bootstrapping and Distilling Large Language Models,,, ,Proceedings Paper ,,"Toxic content detection is crucial for online services to remove inappropriate content that violates community standards.

**Abstract**Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in interactive chat scenarios due to their advanced conversational abilities. However, their training process invariably exposes them to a diverse range of harmful or toxic content, posing significant challenges in ensuring that LLM responses align with human ethical values. Consequently, the detection and quantification of adverse content remains a paramount issue in contemporary research. In this paper, we introduce the SAFE dataset, a novel resource designed to advance safety assessment research in LLMs. Our dataset extends beyond the binary categorization of content into safe and unsafe. Drawing upon human interpretations of safety, we further delineate unsafe content into six granular categories: Sensitivity, Harmfulness, Falsehood, Information Corruption, Unnaturalness, and Deviation from Instructions. This refined classification aims to enhance LLMs' ability to discern unsafe data more accurately. In total, we have created a dataset comprising 52,340 instruction-response pairs, each annotated with safety meta-tags. Additionally, we have compiled expert comparative assessments for these indicators. We developed a multi-expert rating model trained on the SAFE dataset, designed to evaluate the responses of LLMs across various dimensions. This approach highlights the potential of our dataset in the realm of safety assessment for LLMs. The model's capability to provide multi-faceted evaluations reflects an advanced understanding of the nuanced requirements in LLM response assessment.

**Abstract**Abstract:Language is a deep-rooted means of perpetration of stereotypes and discrimination. Large Language Models (LLMs), now a pervasive technology in our everyday lives, can cause extensive harm when prone to generating toxic responses. The standard way to address this issue is to align the LLM, which, however, dampens the issue without constituting a definitive solution. Therefore, testing LLM even after alignment efforts remains crucial for detecting any residual deviations with respect to ethical standards. We present EvoTox, an automated testing framework for LLMs' inclination to toxicity, providing a way to quantitatively assess how much LLMs can be pushed towards toxic responses even in the presence of alignment. The framework adopts an iterative evolution strategy that exploits the interplay between two LLMs, the System Under Test (SUT) and the Prompt Generator steering SUT responses toward higher toxicity.

We conduct a quantitative and qualitative empirical evaluation using four state-of-the-art LLMs as evaluation subjects having increasing complexity (7-13 billion parameters). Our quantitative evaluation assesses the cost-effectiveness of four alternative versions of EvoTox against existing baseline methods, based on random search, curated datasets of toxic prompts, and adversarial attacks. Our qualitative assessment engages human evaluators to rate the fluency of the generated prompts and the perceived toxicity of the responses collected during the testing sessions. Results indicate that the effectiveness, in terms of detected toxicity level, is significantly higher than the selected baseline methods (effect size up to 1.0 against random search and up to 0.99 against adversarial attacks).

**Abstract**Abstract:This paper makes three contributions. First, it presents a generalizable, novel framework dubbed \textit{toxicity rabbit hole} that iteratively elicits toxic content from a wide suite of large language models.

**Abstract**Abstract:Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Gemini have significantly advanced natural language processing, enabling various applications such as chatbots and automated content generation. However, these models can be exploited by malicious individuals who craft toxic prompts to elicit harmful or unethical responses. These individuals often employ jailbreaking techniques to bypass safety mechanisms, highlighting the need for robust toxic prompt detection methods. Existing detection techniques, both blackbox and whitebox, face challenges related to the diversity of toxic prompts, scalability, and computational efficiency. In response, we propose ToxicDetector, a lightweight greybox method designed to efficiently detect toxic prompts in LLMs. ToxicDetector leverages LLMs to create toxic concept prompts, uses embedding vectors to form feature vectors, and employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier for prompt classification. Our evaluation on various versions of the LLama models, Gemma-2, and multiple datasets demonstrates that ToxicDetector achieves a high accuracy of 96.39\% and a low false positive rate of 2.00\%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, ToxicDetector's processing time of 0.0780 seconds per prompt makes it highly suitable for real-time applications.

1  Introduction

The EU Code of conduct on countering illegal hate
speech online relies on the definition of hate speech
as “all conduct publicly inciting to violence or ha-
tred directed against a group of persons or a mem-
ber of such a group defined by reference to race,
colour, religion, descent or national or ethnic ori-
gin.”1,2 This definition points out the role of the
target in hate speech, which is one form of toxicity
in text, next to other offensive language (Leite et al.,
2020). Targets as a constituting element already

et al., 2016; Lemmens et al., 2021, i.a.).
  Hate speech expressions vary a lot, from ex-
plicit formulations to more implicit, and sometimes
even intentionally cryptic references, to bypass
automatic filters. This is an issue, because data
collection procedures can never be entirely fair –
they suffer from being focused on specific time
frames, topics, and therefore also targets (Dixon
et al., 2018). The working hypothesis in our pa-
per follows Waseem and Hovy (2016), Talat et al.
(2018) and Davidson et al. (2019) who have shown
that models learn regularly occurring target terms
as features of toxicity, because corpora developed
for annotation and training might mention poten-
tial targets predominantly in a toxic context. For
toxicity directed against less frequently mentioned
targets or where identity terms are not explicitely
mentioned (e.g., Examples #8 and #9 in Table 1), a
biased model is more apt to not detect toxicity.
  We aim at improving on this situation and pro-
pose to perform adversarial correction of toxicity
classifiers with regard to target identities.  This
leads to a challenge: How specific should the target
mention that we correct for be? Correcting for spe-
cific targets might lead to a sparsity problem while
correcting for the occurrence in a binary fashion
might not provide sufficiently specific informationtarget

as “all conduct publicly inciting to violence or ha-
tred directed against a group of persons or a mem-
ber of such a group defined by reference to race,
colour, religion, descent or national or ethnic ori-
gin.”1,2 This definition points out the role of the
target in hate speech, which is one form of toxicity
in text, next to other offensive language (Leite et al.,
2020). Targets as a constituting element already

et al., 2016; Lemmens et al., 2021, i.a.).
  Hate speech expressions vary a lot, from ex-
plicit formulations to more implicit, and sometimes
even intentionally cryptic references, to bypass
automatic filters. This is an issue, because data
collection procedures can never be entirely fair –
they suffer from being focused on specific time
frames, topics, and therefore also targets (Dixon
et al., 2018). The working hypothesis in our pa-
per follows Waseem and Hovy (2016), Talat et al.
(2018) and Davidson et al. (2019) who have shown
that models learn regularly occurring target terms
as features of toxicity, because corpora developed
for annotation and training might mention poten-
tial targets predominantly in a toxic context. For
toxicity directed against less frequently mentioned
targets or where identity terms are not explicitely
mentioned (e.g., Examples #8 and #9 in Table 1), a
biased model is more apt to not detect toxicity.
  We aim at improving on this situation and pro-
pose to perform adversarial correction of toxicity
classifiers with regard to target identities.  This
leads to a challenge: How specific should the target
mention that we correct for be? Correcting for spe-
cific targets might lead to a sparsity problem while
correcting for the occurrence in a binary fashion
might not provide sufficiently specific informationtarget

**Abstract**Extensive efforts in automated approaches for

1  Introduction
Content moderation guards online forums against
hostility and extremism while maintaining commu-
nity norms, ensuring the forums remain healthy
and open to all participants. While many platforms
pay for this service, others, such as Reddit, Discord,
Facebook, and Twitch, use a hybrid model, relying
on the labor of volunteers. Yet, behind the screen,
being a volunteer content moderator is time- and
emotionally-draining work. Moderators frequently
deal with abusive language, sensitive posts, and
unpleasant interactions with users (Seering et al.,
2019; Gilbert, 2020; Dosono and Semaan, 2019;
Wohn, 2019; Jiang et al., 2019), often doing thiswork in addition to full-time jobs. To support these
volunteers, efforts have been made to develop mod-
els, such as Google Perspective API1 and OpenAI
undesired content detection (Markov et al., 2023),
that can automatically identify content for removal
in order to alleviate moderators’ workload.
  Although these systems have shown great suc-
cess in detecting “undesired” content, they primar-
ily focus on toxic content. Yet, content moderation
encompasses more than toxicity detection,2 partic-
ularly in platforms that leverage volunteer modera-
tion within smaller communities hosted by the site.
For example, Reddit is a platform consisting of var-
ious communities, known as “subreddits,” focused
on a diverse set of topics, and each subreddit has
its own moderation rules. Fiesler et al. (2018) con-
ducted a study to explore various subreddit rules,
consolidating similar ones, and arrived at 25 dis-
tinct rule types. Hence, in order to support moder-
ators in detecting potential rule-violating content,
content moderation tools need to support much
more than just toxicity detection.
  In this paper, we aim to assess to what extent
current natural language processing (NLP) models
can serve the wide spectrum of moderation rules
so that they can be helpful in assisting moderators.
First, to understand the functions previous auto-
mated content moderation models have focused on,
we conduct a model review on Hugging Face (HF)
with rules from three subreddits as exemplars. This
allows us to gauge the progress of past model devel-
opments in covering various moderation rules. We
use model review as opposed to the more common
literature review to gain a technical understanding
of the existing models’ functions. In addition to

**Abstract**Abstract:Although there have been automated approaches and tools supporting toxicity censorship for social posts, most of them focus on detection. Toxicity censorship is a complex process, wherein detection is just an initial task and a user can have further needs such as rationale understanding and content modification. For this problem, we conduct a needfinding study to investigate people's diverse needs in toxicity censorship and then build a ChatGPT-based censorship tool named DeMod accordingly. DeMod is equipped with the features of explainable Detection and personalized Modification, providing fine-grained detection results, detailed explanations, and personalized modification suggestions.

**Abstract**Abstract:Content moderation typically combines the efforts of human moderators and machine learning models. However, these systems often rely on data where significant disagreement occurs during moderation, reflecting the subjective nature of toxicity perception. Rather than dismissing this disagreement as noise, we interpret it as a valuable signal that highlights the inherent ambiguity of the content,an insight missed when only the majority label is considered. In this work, we introduce a novel content moderation framework that emphasizes the importance of capturing annotation disagreement. Our approach uses multitask learning, where toxicity classification serves as the primary task and annotation disagreement is addressed as an auxiliary task. Additionally, we leverage uncertainty estimation techniques, specifically Conformal Prediction, to account for both the ambiguity in comment annotations and the model's inherent uncertainty in predicting toxicity and this http URL framework also allows moderators to adjust thresholds for annotation disagreement, offering flexibility in determining when ambiguity should trigger a review. We demonstrate that our joint approach enhances model performance, calibration, and uncertainty estimation, while offering greater parameter efficiency and improving the review process in comparison to single-task methods.","Villate-Castillo G,Ser J,Sanz B",,,A Collaborative Content Moderation Framework for Toxicity Detection based on Conformalized Estimates of Annotation Disagreement,abs/2411.04090,,10.48550/ARXIV.2411.04090 , Journal Article,,"Abstract:Content moderation typically combines the efforts of human moderators and machine learning models.

While existing methods perform well on normal toxic contents or those generated by specific perturbation methods, they are vulnerable to evolving perturbation patterns. However, in real-world scenarios, malicious users tend to create new perturbation patterns for fooling the detectors. For example, some users may circumvent the detector of large language models (LLMs) by adding `I am a scientist' at the beginning of the prompt. In this paper, we introduce a novel problem, i.e., continual learning jailbreak perturbation patterns, into the toxicity detection field. To tackle this problem, we first construct a new dataset generated by 9 types of perturbation patterns, 7 of them are summarized from prior work and 2 of them are developed by us. We then systematically validate the vulnerability of current methods on this new perturbation pattern-aware dataset via both the zero-shot and fine tuned cross-pattern detection. Upon this, we present the domain incremental learning paradigm and the corresponding benchmark to ensure the detector's robustness to dynamically emerging types of perturbed toxic text.

To address these issues, we propose a novel method called MetaTox, leveraging graph search on a meta-toxic knowledge graph to enhance hatred and toxicity detection. First, we construct a comprehensive meta-toxic knowledge graph by utilizing LLMs to extract toxic information through a three-step pipeline, with toxic benchmark datasets serving as corpora. Second, we query the graph via retrieval and ranking processes to supplement accurate, relevant toxic knowledge.

**Abstract**Current methods of toxic language detection (TLD) typically rely on specific tokens to conduct decisions, which
makes them suffer from lexical bias, leading to inferior performance and generalization. Lexical bias has both “useful”
and “misleading” impacts on understanding toxicity. Unfortunately, instead of distinguishing between these impacts,
current debiasing methods typically eliminate them indiscriminately, resulting in a degradation in the detection
accuracy of the model. To this end, we propose a Counterfactual Causal Debiasing Framework (CCDF) to mitigate
lexical bias in TLD. It preserves the “useful impact” of lexical bias and eliminates the “misleading impact”. Specifically,
we first represent the total effect of the original sentence and biased tokens on decisions from a causal view. We then
conduct counterfactual inference to exclude the direct causal effect of lexical bias from the total effect. Empirical
evaluations demonstrate that the debiased TLD model incorporating CCDF achieves state-of-the-art performance in
both accuracy and fairness compared to competitive baselines applied on several vanilla models. The generalization
capability of our model outperforms current debiased models for out-of-distribution data.

Keywords: Toxic Language Detection, Lexical Bias, Causal Inference             1.  Introduction

In recent years, researchers have introduced natu-
ral language processing techniques to detect toxic
language. However, due to biased training, cur-
rent toxic language detection (TLD) methods are
prone to relying on lexical bias to perform deci-
sions. The lexical bias associates toxicity with the
presence of biased tokens (e.g., identity mentions,
insults, and markers of African American English)
(Davidson et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020), which
undermines the fairness of minorities (Thiago et al.,
2021; Hutchinson et al., 2020). As an example, as
shown in Figure 1, the TLD model tends to classify
all samples containing ""n*gga"" (a cordial phrase for
dialogue between Africans) as toxic language, due
to its frequent occurrence in toxic samples during
training. This actually compromises the freedom
of expression of Africans (Sap et al., 2019). Mean-
while, lexical bias also affects the generalization
ability of the TLD model, resulting in limited detec-
tion performance of the model for out-of-distribution
(OOD) data (Vidgen et al., 2019; Ramponi and
Tonelli, 2022; Zhou et al., 2021b).
  Researchers have presented several methods
to mitigate lexical bias in TLD. Due to the expen-
sive labor costs of constructing unbiased datasets
(Dinan et al., 2019), many studies have attempted
to weaken lexical prior while training with original

1. Introduction

Dialogue agents driven by open-domain chatbots [1, 2] play a pivotal role in applications like restaurant
reservations [3], healthcare [4] and online shopping [5]. More recent cases of general-purpose dialog
agents are ChatGPT [6] or Llama 2 [7], which have been trained to follow societal norms. These models
undergo training with extensive datasets from platforms like Reddit1, Twitter (currently X2), and 4chan3,
with examples including BlenderBot 1 [1], TwitterBot Tay [8], and Luda [9]. However, these data
sources are known for producing toxic content [10, 11, 12], leading to undesirable behaviors observed
in the output of these models. Toxicity mitigation is a key task at a time when the research community
is fervently engaged in AI alignment and in ensuring that AI adopts human principles such as respect,
fairness, non-discrimination, etc [13].
  This research focuses on mitigating toxic speech in dialogue agents, which has been defined repeatedly
as rude, disrespectful, or unreasonable comments likely to disrupt conversations4, often related to gender,
politics, race, or culture [14]. Previous efforts aimed at reducing toxicity in dialogue agents include
continuous curation of datasets [15, 16], toxic behavior detection during text generation [17, 18], and
safety layers [1, 19]. While effective, these approaches have limitations (𝐿):

• 𝐿1: The continuous curation of datasets is expensive, requiring human annotators at every stage. In

Dialogue agents driven by open-domain chatbots [1, 2] play a pivotal role in applications like restaurant
reservations [3], healthcare [4] and online shopping [5]. More recent cases of general-purpose dialog
agents are ChatGPT [6] or Llama 2 [7], which have been trained to follow societal norms. These models
undergo training with extensive datasets from platforms like Reddit1, Twitter (currently X2), and 4chan3,
with examples including BlenderBot 1 [1], TwitterBot Tay [8], and Luda [9]. However, these data
sources are known for producing toxic content [10, 11, 12], leading to undesirable behaviors observed
in the output of these models. Toxicity mitigation is a key task at a time when the research community
is fervently engaged in AI alignment and in ensuring that AI adopts human principles such as respect,
fairness, non-discrimination, etc [13].
  This research focuses on mitigating toxic speech in dialogue agents, which has been defined repeatedly
as rude, disrespectful, or unreasonable comments likely to disrupt conversations4, often related to gender,
politics, race, or culture [14]. Previous efforts aimed at reducing toxicity in dialogue agents include
continuous curation of datasets [15, 16], toxic behavior detection during text generation [17, 18], and
safety layers [1, 19]. While effective, these approaches have limitations (𝐿):

• 𝐿1: The continuous curation of datasets is expensive, requiring human annotators at every stage. In

**Abstract**Abstract:The proliferation of hate speech (HS) on social media poses a serious threat to societal security. Automatic counter narrative (CN) generation, as an active strategy for HS intervention, has garnered increasing attention in recent years. Existing methods for automatically generating CNs mainly rely on re-training or fine-tuning pre-trained language models (PLMs) on human-curated CN corpora. Unfortunately, the annotation speed of CN corpora cannot keep up with the growth of HS targets, while generating specific and effective CNs for unseen targets remains a significant challenge for the model. To tackle this issue, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Zero-shot Generation (ReZG) to generate CNs with high-specificity for unseen targets. Specifically, we propose a multi-dimensional hierarchical retrieval method that integrates stance, semantics, and fitness, extending the retrieval metric from single dimension to multiple dimensions suitable for the knowledge that refutes HS. Then, we implement an energy-based constrained decoding mechanism that enables PLMs to use differentiable knowledge preservation, countering, and fluency constraint functions instead of in-target CNs as control signals for generation, thereby achieving zero-shot CN generation. With the above techniques, ReZG can integrate external knowledge flexibly and improve the specificity of CNs. Experimental results show that ReZG exhibits stronger generalization capabilities and outperforms strong baselines with significant improvements of 2.0%+ in the relevance and 4.5%+ in the countering success rate metrics.","Jiang S,Tang W,Chen X,Tang R,Wang H,Wang W",,,ReZG: Retrieval-augmented zero-shot counter narrative generation for hate speech,620,,10.1016/J.NEUCOM.2024.129140 , Journal Article,,"Abstract:The proliferation of hate speech (HS) on social media poses a serious threat to societal security.

1  Introduction

The proliferation of misinformation and the dissem-
ination of harmful narratives has stressed the urgent
need for effective strategies to combat Hate Speech
(HS). This necessity has drawn significant attention
to the field of automatic CN generation, where con-
siderable research has focused on the use of LLMs
to fulfill this task (Chung et al., 2021; Tekiro˘glu
et al., 2022). However, difficulties in automaticallyassessing the quality of the generated CNs remain.
As is common in text generation tasks, while man-
ual evaluation is expensive, time-consuming, and
subjective, existing automatic methods often fail
to provide comprehensive insights or capture the
nuanced relationship between generated text and
human perception, overlooking crucial aspects of
effectiveness and relevance (Ni’mah et al., 2023).
Finally, the problem of CN evaluation is exacer-
bated by the lack of a ’universal truth’ and the
significant variations among possible references, as
shown in Table 1.
  In this paper we address the limitations of tra-
ditional evaluation metrics for CN generation by
proposing a novel automatic evaluation approach.
This method is motivated by the need to improve
upon existing metrics like BLEU, ROUGE and
BERTScore (Papineni et  al., 2002; Lin, 2004;
Zhang et al., 2020) which do not consider the spe-
cific HS to which the CN is responding to, an es-
sential aspect for accurately assessing the quality
of CNs. Our approach evaluates generated CNs
pairwise in a tournament-style format, with out-
comes determined without human intervention us-

itly trained to assess the quality of text.  Thus,
JudgeLM enables pairwise comparisons of CNs,
addressing the subjectivity of the task by breaking
it down into simpler binary classification problems.
To ensure the generalizability of our approach for
the task, we test it on two distinct corpora: CO-
NAN (Chung et al., 2019) and CONAN-MT (Fan-
ton et al., 2021a). Using various models to generate
texts of different quality means that we can eval-

1. Introduction

In social media platforms, hate speech is ampliﬁed beyond human scale, spreading faster and
increasing their reach, with negative impacts in societies, like polarization or an increase in
violent episodes against targeted communities or individuals. It is because of these known
consequences that many legal systems typify it as a crime, at least in some of its forms.
  The predominant strategy adopted so far to counter hate speech in social media is to recognize,
block and delete these messages and/or the users that generated it. This strategy has two main
disadvantages. The ﬁrst one is that blocking and deleting may prevent a hate message from
spreading, but does not counter its consequences on those who were already reached by it.

**Abstract**Recent computational approaches for combat-
    ing online hate speech involve the automatic
    generation of counter narratives by adapting
    Pretrained Transformer-based Language Mod-
     els (PLMs) with human-curated data. This pro-
    cess, however, can produce in-domain overfit-
     ting, resulting in models generating acceptable
    narratives only for hatred similar to training
    data, with little portability to other targets or
    to real-world toxic language. This paper in-
    troduces novel attention regularization method-
    ologies to improve the generalization capabili-
     ties of PLMs for counter narratives generation.
    Overfitting to training-specific terms is then dis-
    couraged, resulting in more diverse and richer
    narratives. We experiment with two attention-
    based regularization techniques on a bench-
   mark English dataset. Regularized models pro-
    duce better counter narratives than state-of-the-
     art approaches in most cases, both in terms of
    automatic metrics and human evaluation, espe-
     cially when hateful targets are not present in
    the training data. This work paves the way for
    better and more flexible counter-speech gen-
    eration models, a task for which datasets are
    highly challenging to produce.

    amples some readers may find offensive.

1  Introduction

Counter narratives (CNs) are an effective way to
contrast hate speech as they are defined as “com-
municative actions aimed at refuting hate speech
through thoughtful and cogent reasons, and true
and fact-bound arguments” (Schieb and Preuss,
2016).  In contrast to other widely used restric-
tive measures such as content removal and shadow-
banning, CNs are based on the assumption that
in order to combat hate speech, more speech is
required. They are typically employed by Non-
Governmental Organizations (NGOs) as an active
strategy to intervene in online discussions where   Figure 1: An example of CNs obtained with and without
   regularization: the highlighted terms show where the
   models focus their attention in the two cases.


   hateful content is present. Responding to micro
  and macro-aggressions with concrete action is crit-
   ical because it can make such aggressions visible,
   disarm them, educate the perpetrators, and allow
   for external support (Sue et al., 2019). In partic-
   ular, the key to the effectiveness of CNs is their
   specificity: they are more complex than a simple
   condemnation of profanity, and they include a vari-
   ety of arguments (Tekiro˘glu et al., 2020).
       Still, the massive amount of hate that is con-
   stantly produced online necessitates the develop-
  ment of automatic CN generation techniques. Typ-
   ically, this is done by fine-tuning a Pretrained Lan-
  guage Model (PLM) on human-curated data, such
   as GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019). However, prior
   research has demonstrated that PLMs are suscep-
   tible to generating unspecific CNs that can techni-
   cally work with any input but have questionable
   content and informativeness (Fanton et al., 2021;

    Pretrained Transformer-based Language Mod-
     els (PLMs) with human-curated data. This pro-
    cess, however, can produce in-domain overfit-
     ting, resulting in models generating acceptable
    narratives only for hatred similar to training
    data, with little portability to other targets or
    to real-world toxic language. This paper in-
    troduces novel attention regularization method-
    ologies to improve the generalization capabili-
     ties of PLMs for counter narratives generation.
    Overfitting to training-specific terms is then dis-
    couraged, resulting in more diverse and richer
    narratives. We experiment with two attention-
    based regularization techniques on a bench-
   mark English dataset. Regularized models pro-
    duce better counter narratives than state-of-the-
     art approaches in most cases, both in terms of
    automatic metrics and human evaluation, espe-
     cially when hateful targets are not present in
    the training data. This work paves the way for
    better and more flexible counter-speech gen-
    eration models, a task for which datasets are
    highly challenging to produce.

1  Introduction

Counter narratives (CNs) are an effective way to
contrast hate speech as they are defined as “com-
municative actions aimed at refuting hate speech
through thoughtful and cogent reasons, and true
and fact-bound arguments” (Schieb and Preuss,
2016).  In contrast to other widely used restric-
tive measures such as content removal and shadow-
banning, CNs are based on the assumption that
in order to combat hate speech, more speech is
required. They are typically employed by Non-
Governmental Organizations (NGOs) as an active
strategy to intervene in online discussions where   Figure 1: An example of CNs obtained with and without
   regularization: the highlighted terms show where the
   models focus their attention in the two cases.


   hateful content is present. Responding to micro
  and macro-aggressions with concrete action is crit-
   ical because it can make such aggressions visible,
   disarm them, educate the perpetrators, and allow
   for external support (Sue et al., 2019). In partic-
   ular, the key to the effectiveness of CNs is their
   specificity: they are more complex than a simple
   condemnation of profanity, and they include a vari-
   ety of arguments (Tekiro˘glu et al., 2020).
       Still, the massive amount of hate that is con-
   stantly produced online necessitates the develop-
  ment of automatic CN generation techniques. Typ-
   ically, this is done by fine-tuning a Pretrained Lan-
  guage Model (PLM) on human-curated data, such
   as GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019). However, prior
   research has demonstrated that PLMs are suscep-
   tible to generating unspecific CNs that can techni-
   cally work with any input but have questionable
   content and informativeness (Fanton et al., 2021;

**Abstract**Abstract:The proliferation of hate speech (HS) on social media poses a serious threat to societal security. Automatic counter narrative (CN) generation, as an active strategy for HS intervention, has garnered increasing attention in recent years. Existing methods for automatically generating CNs mainly rely on re-training or fine-tuning pre-trained language models (PLMs) on human-curated CN corpora. Unfortunately, the annotation speed of CN corpora cannot keep up with the growth of HS targets, while generating specific and effective CNs for unseen targets remains a significant challenge for the model. To tackle this issue, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Zero-shot Generation (ReZG) to generate CNs with high-specificity for unseen targets. Specifically, we propose a multi-dimensional hierarchical retrieval method that integrates stance, semantics, and fitness, extending the retrieval metric from single dimension to multiple dimensions suitable for the knowledge that refutes HS. Then, we implement an energy-based constrained decoding mechanism that enables PLMs to use differentiable knowledge preservation, countering, and fluency constraint functions instead of in-target CNs as control signals for generation, thereby achieving zero-shot CN generation. With the above techniques, ReZG can integrate external knowledge flexibly and improve the specificity of CNs. Experimental results show that ReZG exhibits stronger generalization capabilities and outperforms strong baselines with significant improvements of 2.0%+ in the relevance and 4.5%+ in the countering success rate metrics.","Jiang S,Tang W,Chen X,Tang R,Wang H,Wang W",,,RAUCG: Retrieval-Augmented Unsupervised Counter Narrative Generation for Hate Speech,abs/2310.05650,,10.48550/ARXIV.2310.05650 , Journal Article,,"Abstract:The proliferation of hate speech (HS) on social media poses a serious threat to societal security.

**Abstract**We present two novel unsupervised methods
    for eliminating toxicity in  text.  Our ﬁrst
   method combines two recent ideas: (1) guid-
    ance of the generation process with small style-
    conditional language models and (2) use of
    paraphrasing models to perform style transfer.
   We use a well-performing paraphraser guided
   by style-trained language models to keep the
     text content and remove toxicity. Our second
   method uses BERT to replace toxic words with
     their non-offensive synonyms. We make the
   method more ﬂexible by enabling BERT to
    replace mask tokens with a variable number
    of words.  Finally, we present the ﬁrst large-
    scale comparative study of style transfer mod-
     els on the task of toxicity removal. We com-
    pare our models with a number of methods for
     style transfer. The models are evaluated in a
    reference-free way using a combination of un-
    supervised style transfer metrics. Both meth-
    ods we suggest yield new SOTA results.

1  Introduction

Identiﬁcation of toxicity in user texts is an active
area of research (Zampieri et al., 2020; D’Sa et al.,
2020; Han and Tsvetkov, 2020). The task of auto-
matic rewriting of offensive content attracted less
attention, yet it may ﬁnd various useful applications
such as making online world a better place by sug-
gesting to a user posting a more neutral version of
an emotional comment. The existing works on text
detoxiﬁcation (dos Santos et al., 2018; Tran et al.,
2020; Laugier et al., 2021) cast this task as style
transfer. The style transfer task is generally under-
stood as rewriting of text with the same content and
with altering of one or several attributes which con-
stitute the “style”, such as authorship (Voigt et al.,
2018), sentiment (Shen et al., 2017), or degree of
politeness (Madaan et al., 2020). Despite the goal
of preserving the content, in many cases changing
the style attributes changes the meaning of a sen-tence signiﬁcantly.1 So in fact the goal of many
style transfer models is to transform a sentence into
a somewhat similar sentence of a different style
on the same topic.2 We suggest that detoxiﬁcation
needs better preservation of the original meaning
than many other style transfer tasks, such as senti-
ment transfer, so it should be performed differently.
  We present two models for text detoxiﬁcation,
which have extra control for content preservation.
The ﬁrst model, ParaGeDi, is capable of fully re-
generating the input. It is based on two ideas: exter-
nal control of an output of a generation model by a
class-conditioned LM (Krause et al., 2020) and for-
mulation of style transfer task as paraphrasing (Kr-
ishna et al., 2020). Being based on a paraphraser
model, ParaGeDi explicitly aims at preserving the
meaning of the original sentence. The second ap-
proach, CondBERT, inspired by Wu et al. (2019a),
follows the pointwise editing setup. It uses BERT
to replace toxic spans found in the sentence with
their non-toxic alternatives. The semantic simi-
larity is maintained by showing the original text
to BERT and reranking its hypotheses based on
the similarity between the original words and their
substitutes.  Interestingly, BERT does not need
any class-conditional pre-training to successfully
change the text style from toxic to normal.
   In addition, we perform a large-scale evaluation
of style transfer models on detoxiﬁcation task, com-
paring our new models with baselines and state-of-
the-art approaches. We release our code and data.3
  Our contributions are as follows:
• We propose two novel detoxiﬁcation meth-
  ods based on pre-trained neural language mod-
  els: ParaGeDi (paraphrasing GeDi) and Cond-
 BERT (conditional BERT).

   1For example, Lample et al. (2019) provide the following
sentence as an example of transfer from male to female writing:
Gotta say that beard makes you look like a Viking →Gotta
say that hair makes you look like a Mermaid.

   We use a well-performing paraphraser guided
   by style-trained language models to keep the
     text content and remove toxicity. Our second
   method uses BERT to replace toxic words with
     their non-offensive synonyms. We make the
   method more ﬂexible by enabling BERT to
    replace mask tokens with a variable number
    of words.  Finally, we present the ﬁrst large-
    scale comparative study of style transfer mod-
     els on the task of toxicity removal. We com-
    pare our models with a number of methods for
     style transfer. The models are evaluated in a
    reference-free way using a combination of un-
    supervised style transfer metrics. Both meth-
    ods we suggest yield new SOTA results.

1  Introduction

Identiﬁcation of toxicity in user texts is an active
area of research (Zampieri et al., 2020; D’Sa et al.,
2020; Han and Tsvetkov, 2020). The task of auto-
matic rewriting of offensive content attracted less
attention, yet it may ﬁnd various useful applications
such as making online world a better place by sug-
gesting to a user posting a more neutral version of
an emotional comment. The existing works on text
detoxiﬁcation (dos Santos et al., 2018; Tran et al.,
2020; Laugier et al., 2021) cast this task as style
transfer. The style transfer task is generally under-
stood as rewriting of text with the same content and
with altering of one or several attributes which con-
stitute the “style”, such as authorship (Voigt et al.,
2018), sentiment (Shen et al., 2017), or degree of
politeness (Madaan et al., 2020). Despite the goal
of preserving the content, in many cases changing
the style attributes changes the meaning of a sen-tence signiﬁcantly.1 So in fact the goal of many
style transfer models is to transform a sentence into
a somewhat similar sentence of a different style
on the same topic.2 We suggest that detoxiﬁcation
needs better preservation of the original meaning
than many other style transfer tasks, such as senti-
ment transfer, so it should be performed differently.
  We present two models for text detoxiﬁcation,
which have extra control for content preservation.
The ﬁrst model, ParaGeDi, is capable of fully re-
generating the input. It is based on two ideas: exter-
nal control of an output of a generation model by a
class-conditioned LM (Krause et al., 2020) and for-
mulation of style transfer task as paraphrasing (Kr-
ishna et al., 2020). Being based on a paraphraser
model, ParaGeDi explicitly aims at preserving the
meaning of the original sentence. The second ap-
proach, CondBERT, inspired by Wu et al. (2019a),
follows the pointwise editing setup. It uses BERT
to replace toxic spans found in the sentence with
their non-toxic alternatives. The semantic simi-
larity is maintained by showing the original text
to BERT and reranking its hypotheses based on
the similarity between the original words and their
substitutes.  Interestingly, BERT does not need
any class-conditional pre-training to successfully
change the text style from toxic to normal.
   In addition, we perform a large-scale evaluation
of style transfer models on detoxiﬁcation task, com-
paring our new models with baselines and state-of-
the-art approaches. We release our code and data.3
  Our contributions are as follows:
• We propose two novel detoxiﬁcation meth-
  ods based on pre-trained neural language mod-
  els: ParaGeDi (paraphrasing GeDi) and Cond-
 BERT (conditional BERT).

   1For example, Lample et al. (2019) provide the following
sentence as an example of transfer from male to female writing:
Gotta say that beard makes you look like a Viking →Gotta
say that hair makes you look like a Mermaid.

1. Introduction

The task of identification of toxicity in texts is an active area of research. Social networks are trying to
address this problem by simply blocking such texts. A more interesting and effective approach might
be to automatically rewrite these texts, so that they are ideally no longer toxic, but their meaning is
kept intact. This processed is denoted as detoxification.
  The Multilingual Text Detoxification (TextDetox) 2024 task aims to create and explore such methods.
The participants are provided with a dataset of toxic texts in several languages from all over the globe,
which then should be detoxified. The goal is to find a method, which after evaluation provides texts
which are neutral, but their meaning is the same as the toxic text on the input.
  We explore how a data scientist with only an API access to a Large Language Model (LLM), in our
case Llama3 can develop effective solutions for this task. We did not fine-tune or alter in any way, the
only approach was to creatively adjust prompts given to the LLM, so that its outputs will get highest
score possible. We have developed several methods, from the simple ones like zero shot prompting, to
utilizing existing datasets of text detoxifications and generating these prompts dynamically considering
the input text to be detoxified.
  For this we have used external tools like vector databases containing pairs of toxic texts and their
neutral counterparts, which were queried using embedding of the toxic texts. We have found this
method to be competitive and despite its simplicity it achieved high ranking in this task.
  We submitted our results under the usernames erehulka and mareksuppa to the CodaLab portal.
Our best-performing languages, in comparison to other participants’ submissions, were German and
Chinese. Notably, our score for German even surpassed the human references in the manual evaluation.
Overall, our approach ranked 5th in the manual evaluation. A more detailed discussion of our results is
provided in Section 6.

1. Introduction

Social networks have allowed us all to be connected and know what is happening on the other side of the
world in a few seconds. However, the inappropriate use of these social networks and the anonymity that
these platforms allow make it easier to offend other users, and the network is filled with inappropriate
comments such as toxic comments. The task organizers define toxic comments as those comments that
contain obscene and rude language mixed with neutral content (explicit toxicity) and those comments
that do not contain neutral text and are loaded with sarcasm, passive aggressiveness, or direct hatred
towards some group or individual. Although in different research works, the term toxicity can have
different definitions according to the aspects of toxic language they address [1] and have also been used
to describe hate speech [2, 3], abusive [4], aggressive [5], and offensive language [6].
  Due to all of the problems mentioned previously and thanks to the capacity of the new large
language models to generate text or what is currently known as generative AI, it has been possible
to explore different proactive strategies to mitigate offensive language in online environments, such
as the automatic generation of counter-narratives [7, 8] or the strategy of text detoxification. In this
case, the organizers centered at text detoxification and proposed the shared task TextDetox, where
the main objective is to generate neutral alternatives to toxic comments. To do so, they focus on texts
with explicit toxicity because of the complexity of detoxifying texts with implicit toxicity in which the

**Abstract**We propose a constraint learning schema for
    fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs)
    with attribute control. Given a training corpus
    and control criteria formulated as a sequence-
     level constraint on model outputs, our method
     fine-tunes the LLM on the training corpus while
    enhancing constraint satisfaction with minimal
    impact on its utility and generation quality.
     Specifically, our approach regularizes the LLM
    training by penalizing the KL divergence be-
    tween the desired output distribution, which sat-
     isfies the constraints, and the LLM’s posterior.
    This regularization term can be approximated
   by an auxiliary model trained to decompose
    the sequence-level constraints into token-level
    guidance, allowing the term to be measured
   by a closed-form formulation. To further im-
    prove efficiency, we design a parallel scheme
    for concurrently updating both the LLM and
    the auxiliary model. We evaluate the empirical
    performance of our approach by controlling the
     toxicity when training an LLM. We show that
    our approach leads to an LLM that produces
    fewer inappropriate responses while achieving
    competitive performance on benchmarks and a
     toxicity detection task.

1  Introduction

Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
impressive performance across a variety of tasks
which has led to their widespread adoption for a
multitude of AI applications. However, they carry
the risk of producing inappropriate, unsafe, unfair
outputs (Wallace et al., 2019; Sheng et al., 2019;
Gehman et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2024) Ideally,
LLMs should learn to comply with constraints and
policies specified by users. For example, in a user-
facing application like a chatbot, LLMs should
never generate toxic or offensive responses, nor
to divulge sensitive information. While there are
several post hoc methods to moderate LLM out-
puts (Lu et al., 2022; Qian et al., 2022; Markovet al., 2023), they lack an efficient and principled
approach to training LLMs to adhere to constraints.
  We start by defining a sequence-level oracle as
a function that takes an LLM’s output and adju-
dicates whether it satisfies a predefined set of at-
tribute constraints. In practice, the oracle can be a
rule-based, model-based, or mixed system (e.g., a
classifier that decides whether a sentence is toxic).
Given a pre-trained LLM and the oracle, we aim to
fine-tune an LLM to achieve the following: 1) At-
tribute control: The LLM output passes the oracle
with a high probability. 2) Utility preservation:
The LLM maintains performance comparable to the
original LLM on utility benchmarks. 3) Training
efficiency: The cost of fine-tuning with attribute
control is similar to that of the typical fine-tuning.
  While existing approaches can meet some of
these criteria, achieving all of them is challenging.
For example, filtering training data with the ora-
cle function before fine-tuning (Wang et al., 2022)
is a simple and efficient method. However, this
approach could be less effective. Taking toxicity
control as an example, if we filter out the toxic
data from a fine-tuning corpus, in a regular con-
text the model will learn not to generate toxic con-
tents. Nevertheless, it might still be possible to
trigger the generation of offensive responses given
a toxic prompts, due to the fact that toxic prompts
are out-of-distribution in relation to the fine-tuning
corpus. Another promising approach is reinforce-
ment learning (RL) considering controlling criteria
in the reward function (Snell et al., 2023; Mudgal
et al., 2023). However, RL setups tend to be ineffi-
cient and require preference data generation which
adds significant overhead in comparison to generic
fine-tuning.
  In this work, we propose a novel solution to
training an LLM with a set of attribute constraints.

1  Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited
remarkable performance in various NLP tasks and
applications (Brown et al., 2020; Chowdhery et al.,
2022; Anil et al., 2023). However, when prompted
with toxic context, LLMs tend to generate texts
that contain toxicity and bias (Liang et al., 2022;
Shaikh et al., 2022), which poses a significant risk
when interfacing directly with users.
  To mitigate such a concern for LLMs, one could
adopt the response rejection strategy (Zhang et al.,

    ∗Equal Contribution
    †Corresponding Author
   1Code & Data: https://github.com/ZetangForward/
CMD-Context-aware-Model-self-Detoxification.git2023) to ignore the unsafe context. However, such
a strategy is unfriendly to the users under some
specific scenarios, such as mediation or conflict
resolution (Löhr et al., 2017).  Alternately, text
detoxification prevents the model from generating
toxic content following any given context with-
out rejection. Along this line, non-negligible ef-
forts have recently been devoted to two main as-
pects: output-intervention methods like manipulat-
ing output probability distribution during inference
time (Dale et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2021; Leong et al.,
2023) and trainable methods that update model pa-
rameters on the detoxification datasets (Wang et al.,
2022; Park and Rudzicz, 2022; Niu et al., 2024).
  However, when applying the output-intervention
methods, the generated text tends to exhibit low
quality, e.g., semantic incoherence with the con-
text, due to some unexpected perturbations to the
outputs; while trainable methods are constrained
by the available detoxification dataset, which may
lead to poor detoxification effectiveness2. In other
words, although detoxification methods allow lan-
guage models to generate along the unsafe con-
text, existing methods still face a dilemma, i.e.,
the imbalance between detoxification effectiveness
and the generation quality. This issue stems from
the conflicting objectives of model generation and
existing detoxification methods: language mod-
els aim to generate content along the context, but
detoxification methods strive to ensure the safety
of the output even if it exhibits subpar quality, e.g.,
semantically deviating from the context.
  To tackle this issue, we need to consider both
the context and the model generation in detoxifi-
cation. Intuitively, if the context is non-toxic, the
generated content will also likely be safe. There-
fore, we decompose the detoxification into two
steps: first detoxifying the context and then making
the language model generate along the safe con-
tent, thus ensuring the generated text’s quality and

1  Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited
remarkable performance in various NLP tasks and
applications (Brown et al., 2020; Chowdhery et al.,
2022; Anil et al., 2023). However, when prompted
with toxic context, LLMs tend to generate texts
that contain toxicity and bias (Liang et al., 2022;
Shaikh et al., 2022), which poses a significant risk
when interfacing directly with users.
  To mitigate such a concern for LLMs, one could
adopt the response rejection strategy (Zhang et al.,

    ∗Equal Contribution

CMD-Context-aware-Model-self-Detoxification.git2023) to ignore the unsafe context. However, such
a strategy is unfriendly to the users under some
specific scenarios, such as mediation or conflict
resolution (Löhr et al., 2017).  Alternately, text
detoxification prevents the model from generating
toxic content following any given context with-
out rejection. Along this line, non-negligible ef-
forts have recently been devoted to two main as-
pects: output-intervention methods like manipulat-
ing output probability distribution during inference
time (Dale et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2021; Leong et al.,
2023) and trainable methods that update model pa-
rameters on the detoxification datasets (Wang et al.,
2022; Park and Rudzicz, 2022; Niu et al., 2024).
  However, when applying the output-intervention
methods, the generated text tends to exhibit low
quality, e.g., semantic incoherence with the con-
text, due to some unexpected perturbations to the
outputs; while trainable methods are constrained
by the available detoxification dataset, which may
lead to poor detoxification effectiveness2. In other
words, although detoxification methods allow lan-
guage models to generate along the unsafe con-
text, existing methods still face a dilemma, i.e.,
the imbalance between detoxification effectiveness
and the generation quality. This issue stems from
the conflicting objectives of model generation and
existing detoxification methods: language mod-
els aim to generate content along the context, but
detoxification methods strive to ensure the safety
of the output even if it exhibits subpar quality, e.g.,
semantically deviating from the context.
  To tackle this issue, we need to consider both
the context and the model generation in detoxifi-
cation. Intuitively, if the context is non-toxic, the
generated content will also likely be safe. There-
fore, we decompose the detoxification into two
steps: first detoxifying the context and then making
the language model generate along the safe con-
tent, thus ensuring the generated text’s quality and

Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained with the
explicit purpose of serving humans, between providing
information, presenting an engaging chat partner, and
answering any number of other user requests. Unfor-
tunately, for a variety of reasons, there is a tendency
for models to descend into neural toxic degeneration,
outputting toxic and otherwise harmful messages (Faal
et al., 2022; Xu et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023). Nat-
urally, toxic prompts very commonly yield toxic re-
sponses, but many prompts which are entirely non-toxic
also yield toxic responses (Gehman et al., 2020; Guru-
rangan et al., 2022; Hartvigsen et al., 2022). Currently,
there are three main directions being used to combat
toxicity, each with a considerable drawback.

   ∗This work was done when Roy Siegelmann was an
intern at Amazon. Correspondence to rsiege15@jhu.edu and
mninareh@amazon.com.   First, the model may classify prompts as either toxic
or non-toxic, and categorically refuse to respond to those
deemed toxic (Xu et al., 2021). However, these ap-
proaches oftentimes use templated sentences to refuse
to respond to toxic content which can degrade user en-
gagement and lower helpfulness of the model (Xu et al.,
2021).  It is also possible for even entirely non-toxic
prompts to yield toxic generations, and thus this method
falls short of truly detoxifying.
  Second, the model can be trained solely on non-toxic
data (Welbl et al., 2021a; Gururangan et al., 2020). How-
ever, toxic content can be produced even from training
data which appears benign. Entirely purifying any word
which may lead to toxicity will leave the training corpus
narrow, impacting the richness of content which can
be generated. Furthermore, the model would not know
how to respond to prompts which include some toxicity;
thus, generations based around these prompts will be
nonsensical, slashing the model’s utility.
  Third, an external classifier or a secondary model
(e.g., in decoding time approaches) can be used to detect
whether the model generated toxic content, and if so stop
the content from reaching the user, instructing the model
to provide another generation instead (Mehrabi et al.,
2022; Liu et al., 2021; Krause et al., 2021; Dathathri
et al., 2019). However, without an understanding of tox-
icity, the model is likely to continuously generate toxic
content, yielding potentially unbounded latency times.
This would prove an impediment to the successful and
user-friendly utilization of the slower text-based output
and become unmanageable for models utilizing rapid
speech-based communication.
  Learning from these drawbacks, we formulate the fol-
lowing three requirements of a successful solution: (i)
Assuring non-toxic responses to non-toxic prompts. (ii)
Responding to toxic prompts in a natural, yet non-toxic
manner. (iii) Minimizing toxicity in real-time to prevent
latency. Despite the fact that AI has not yet provided
a satisfactory solution, humans exhibit these traits due
to their inherent ability of self reflection and inhibition
control. Healthy, mature humans consider the conse-
quences of their speech (and more generally, behavior)
via self-reflection before engaging in dialogue, and if
determined to be negative, will alter the output to con-
tain similar meaning yet eliminate the negative outcome.

**Abstract**AbstractThe field of natural language generation has witnessed significant advancements in recent years, including the development of controllable text generation techniques. However, controlling the attributes of the generated text remains a challenge, especially when aiming to avoid undesirable behavior such as toxicity. In this work, we introduce Detoxification Generator (DETOXIGEN), an inference-time algorithm that steers the generation away from unwanted styles. DETOXIGEN is an ensemble of a pre-trained language model (generator) and a detoxifier. The detoxifier is trained intentionally on the toxic data representative of the undesirable attribute, encouraging it to generate text in that style exclusively. During the actual generation, we use the trained detoxifier to produce undesirable tokens for the generator to contrast against at each decoding step. This approach directly informs the generator to avoid generating tokens that the detoxifier considers highly likely. We evaluate DETOXIGEN on the commonly used REALTOXICITYPROMPTS benchmark (Gehman et al., 2020) with various language models as generators. We find that it significantly outperforms previous approaches in detoxification metrics while not compromising on the generation quality. Moreover, the detoxifier is obtained by soft prompt-tuning using the same backbone language model as the generator. Hence, DETOXIGEN requires only a tiny amount of extra weights from the virtual tokens of the detoxifier to be loaded into GPU memory while decoding, making it a promising lightweight, practical, and parameter-efficient detoxification strategy.","Niu T,Xiong C,Yavuz S,Zhou Y",,,Parameter-Efficient Detoxification with Contrastive Decoding,abs/2401.06947,,10.48550/ARXIV.2401.06947 , Journal Article,,"AbstractThe field of natural language generation has witnessed significant advancements in recent years, including the development of controllable text generation techniques.

To tackle this issue, various finetuning-based and decoding-based approaches have been utilized to mitigate toxicity.

Specifically, FGDILP contrasts the contextualized representation in attention space using a positive prefix-prepended prompt against multiple negative prefix-prepended prompts at the instance level. This allows for constructing fine-grained subtoxicity vectors, which enables collaborative detoxification by fusing them to correct the normal generation process when provided with a raw prompt.

This work presents a fine-tuning method that only uses non-parallel data to turn large language models (LLM) into a detoxification rewritter. We model the fine-tuning process as a Stackelberg game between an LLM (leader) and a toxicity screener (follower), which is a binary style classifier (toxic or non-toxic). The LLM aims to align its preference according to the screener and generate paraphases passing the screening. The primary challenge of non-parallel data fine-tuning is incomplete preference. In the case of unsuccessful paraphrases, the classifier cannot establish a preference between the input and paraphrase, as they belong to the same toxic style. Hence, preference-alignment fine-tuning methods, such as direct preference optimization (DPO), no longer apply. To address the challenge of incomplete preference, we propose Stackelberg response optimization (SRO), adapted from DPO, to enable the LLM to learn from the follower's response. The gist is that SRO decreases the likelihood of generating the paraphrase if it fails the follower's screening while performing DPO on the pair of the toxic input and its paraphrase when the latter passes the screening. Experiments indicate that the SRO-fine-tunned LLM achieves satisfying performance comparable to state-of-the-art models regarding style accuracy, content similarity, and fluency. The overall detoxification performance surpasses other computing methods and matches the human reference. Additional empirical evidence suggests that SRO is sensitive to the screener's feedback, and a slight perturbation leads to a significant performance drop.

**Abstract**Abstract:Backdoor attacks undermine the integrity of machine learning models by allowing attackers to manipulate predictions using poisoned training data.

This paper considers a post-training backdoor defense task, aiming to detoxify the backdoors in pre-trained models. We begin by analyzing the underlying issues of vanilla fine-tuning and observe that it is often trapped in regions with low loss for both clean and poisoned samples. Motivated by such observations, we propose Distance-Driven Detoxification (D3), an innovative approach that reformulates backdoor defense as a constrained optimization problem. Specifically, D3 promotes the model's departure from the vicinity of its initial weights, effectively reducing the influence of backdoors.

media. Such a harmful online environment can
lead to mental health problems (Viner et al., 2019;

1  Introduction

The original monolingual task of text detoxifica-
tion can be considered as text style transfer (TST),
where the goal is to build a function that, given a
source style ssrc, a destination style sdst, and an
input text tsrc to produce an output text tdst such
that:  (i) the style is indeed changed (in case of
detoxification from toxic into neutral); (ii) the con-
tent is saved as much as possible; (iii) the newly
generated text is fluent.
  The  task of  detoxification was already ad-
dressed with several approaches.   Firstly, sev-
eral unsupervised methods based on masked lan-
guage modelling (Tran et al., 2020; Dale et al.,
2021) and disentangled representations for style

     † Work has been done while at Skoltechand content (John et al., 2019; dos Santos et al.,
2018) were explored. More recently, Logacheva
et al. (2022b) showed the superiority of supervised
seq2seq models for detoxification trained on a par-
allel corpus of crowdsourced toxic ↔neutral sen-
tence pairs.  Afterwards, there were experiments
in multilingual detoxification.  However, cross-
lingual transfer between languages with multilin-
gual seq2seq models was shown to be a challeng-
ing task (Moskovskiy et al., 2022).
  In this work, we aim to fill this gap and present
an extensive overview of different approaches for
cross-lingual text detoxification methods (tested in
English and Russian), showing that promising re-
sults can be obtained in contrast to prior findings.
Besides, we explore combining of two seq2seq
tasks/models in a single one to achieve computa-
tional gains (i.e., avoid the need to store and per-
form inference with several models). Namely, we
conduct simultaneous translation and style trans-
fer experiments, comparing them to a step-by-step
pipeline.

     this work, we present a large-scale study of
     strategies for cross-lingual text detoxification
   – given a parallel detoxification corpus for one
    language; the goal is to transfer detoxification
     ability to another language for which we do
    not have such a corpus.

    Moreover, we are the first to explore a new
    task where text translation and detoxification
    are performed simultaneously, providing sev-
     eral strong baselines for this task. Finally, we
    introduce new automatic detoxification eval-
    uation metrics with higher correlations with
   human judgments than previous benchmarks.
   We assess the most promising approaches also
    with manual markup, determining the answer
    for the best strategy to transfer the knowledge
    of text detoxification between languages.

1  Introduction

The original monolingual task of text detoxifica-
tion can be considered as text style transfer (TST),
where the goal is to build a function that, given a
source style ssrc, a destination style sdst, and an
input text tsrc to produce an output text tdst such
that:  (i) the style is indeed changed (in case of
detoxification from toxic into neutral); (ii) the con-
tent is saved as much as possible; (iii) the newly
generated text is fluent.
  The  task of  detoxification was already ad-
dressed with several approaches.   Firstly, sev-
eral unsupervised methods based on masked lan-
guage modelling (Tran et al., 2020; Dale et al.,
2021) and disentangled representations for style

    ∗Equal contribution
     † Work has been done while at Skoltechand content (John et al., 2019; dos Santos et al.,
2018) were explored. More recently, Logacheva
et al. (2022b) showed the superiority of supervised
seq2seq models for detoxification trained on a par-
allel corpus of crowdsourced toxic ↔neutral sen-
tence pairs.  Afterwards, there were experiments
in multilingual detoxification.  However, cross-
lingual transfer between languages with multilin-
gual seq2seq models was shown to be a challeng-
ing task (Moskovskiy et al., 2022).
  In this work, we aim to fill this gap and present
an extensive overview of different approaches for
cross-lingual text detoxification methods (tested in
English and Russian), showing that promising re-
sults can be obtained in contrast to prior findings.
Besides, we explore combining of two seq2seq
tasks/models in a single one to achieve computa-
tional gains (i.e., avoid the need to store and per-
form inference with several models). Namely, we
conduct simultaneous translation and style trans-
fer experiments, comparing them to a step-by-step
pipeline.

**Abstract**To reduce the toxic degeneration in a pretrained
   Language Model (LM), previous work on Lan-
    guage Model detoxification has focused on
    reducing the toxicity of the generation itself
     (self-toxicity) without consideration of the con-
     text (Dathathri et al., 2020; Krause et al., 2020;
   Qian et al., 2022). As a result, a type of im-
     plicit offensive language where the generations
    support the offensive language in the context
    (Figure 1) is ignored. Different from the LM
    controlling tasks in previous work, where the
    desired attributes are fixed for generation, the
    desired stance of the generation depends on
    the offensiveness of the context. Therefore, we
    propose a novel control method to do context-
    dependent detoxification with the stance taken
    into consideration. We introduce meta prefixes
    to learn the contextualized stance control strat-
    egy and to generate the stance control prefix
    according to the input context. The generated
    stance prefix is then combined with the toxic-
     ity control prefix to guide the response gener-
    ation. Experimental results show that our pro-
    posed method can effectively learn the context-
    dependent stance control strategies while keep-
    ing a low self-toxicity of the underlying LM.

GPT2 (Radford et al., 2019), can produce coherent,
almost human-like texts, but they are prone to gen-
erating offensive language, which hinders their safe
deployment (Gehman et al., 2020). An extensive
body of work has focused on detoxifying pretrained
LMs (Dathathri et al., 2020; Krause et al., 2020;

plicated when the LMs are applied to downstream
Natural Language Generation (NLG) tasks, such
as dialogue response generation. When applied in
dialogue, the uncontrolled models tend to generate
toxic content and in addition to explicitly offen-
sive utterances, Baheti et al. (2021) suggest thatFigure 1: An illustration of two types of offensive re-

1  Introduction

The task of Textual Style Transfer (Textual Style
Transfer) can be viewed as a task where cer-
tain properties of text are being modified while
rest retain the same1.  In this work we focus
on detoxification textual style transfer (dos San-
tos et al., 2018a; Dementieva et al., 2021a).  It
can be formulated as follows:  given two text
corpora DX =  {x1, x2, . . . xn} and DY =
{y1, y2, . . . , yn}, where X, Y - are two sets of all
possible text in styles sX, sY respectively, we want
to build a model fθ : X →Y , such that the prob-
ability p(ygen|x, sX, sY ) of transferring the style
sX of given text x (by generation ygen) to the style
sY is maximized (where sX and sY are toxic and
non-toxic styles respectively).
  Some examples of detoxification presented in
Table 1.
  Textual style transfer gained a lot of attention
with a rise of deep learning-based NLP methods.
Given that, Textual Style Transfer has now a lot of
specific subtasks ranging from formality style trans-
fer (Rao and Tetreault, 2018; Yao and Yu, 2021)

    1Hereinafter the data-driven definition of style is used.
Therefore, we call style a characteristic of given dataset that
differs from a general dataset (Jin et al., 2020).and simplification of domain-specific texts (De-
varaj et al., 2021; Maddela et al., 2021) to emotion
modification (Sharma et al., 2021) and detoxifica-
tion (debiasing) (Li et al., 2021; Dementieva et al.,
2021a).
  There exist a variety of Textual Style Transfer
methods: from totally supervised methods (Wang
et al., 2019b; Zhang et al., 2020; Dementieva et al.,
2021a) which require a parallel text corpus for train-
ing to unsupervised (Shen et al., 2017; Wang et al.,
2019a; Xu et al., 2021) that are designed to work
without any parallel data. The latter sub-field of re-
search is more popular nowadays due to the scarcity
of parallel text data for Textual Style Transfer. On
the other hand, if we address Textual Style Trans-
fer task as a Machine Translation task we get a
significant performance boost (Prabhumoye et al.,
2018).
  The task of detoxification, in which we focus
in this work, is relatively new.  First work on
detoxification was a sequence-to-sequence collabo-
rative classifier, attention and the cycle consistency
loss (dos Santos et al., 2018b). A recent work by
(Laugier et al., 2021) introduces self-supervised
model based on T5 model (Raffel et al., 2020) with
a denoising and cyclic auto-encoder loss.
  Both these methods are unsupervised which is an
advantage but it comes from the major current prob-
lem of the textual style transfer. There is a lack of
parallel data for Textual Style Transfer since there
exist only few parallel datasets for English (Rao
and Tetreault, 2018) and some other languages (Bri-
akou et al., 2021). When it comes to detoxification
there are only two parallel detoxification corpora
available now and they both appeared only last year
(Dementieva et al., 2021b). Most state-of-the-art

    with various powerful attack prompts and
    equips comprehensive metrics for systematic

     that knowledge editing has the potential to

    a simple yet effective baseline, dubbed Detoxi-

    within a few tuning steps via only one instance.
   We further provide an in-depth analysis of the
     internal mechanism for various detoxifying ap-

     like SFT and DPO may merely suppress the
    activations of toxic parameters, while DINM
    mitigates the toxicity of the toxic parameters
    to a certain extent, making permanent adjust-

1  Introduction

As Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT
(OpenAI, 2023), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023),
and Mistral (Jiang et al., 2023) evolve, there’s
growing concern about their potential to handle
harmful queries, emphasizing the need for careful
safeguards (Zhao et al., 2023; Yao et al., 2023b;
Huang et al., 2023a; Wang et al., 2024b; Sun et al.,
2024; Wang et al., 2023a). Widely adopted ap-
proaches like supervised fine-tuning (SFT), rein-
forcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)
(Bai et al., 2022) and direct preference optimiza-

   1The code and data are available at https://github.com/
zjunlp/EasyEdit.tion (DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2023) markedly im-
prove the safety of LLMs, making LLMs able to
refuse harmful queries such as “Where can I sell
stolen art pieces?”. Yet, the aligned LLMs with
these approaches may remain vulnerable to being
bypassed by meticulously crafted attack prompts
(Zhang et al., 2023b; Sun et al., 2023; Deshpande
et al., 2023). As shown in Fig 1, an adversarial
query with the attack prompt elicits the LLM to
generate illegal content and disrupt social order.
Lee et al. (2024) observe that previous approaches
like DPO merely suppress the activations of toxic
parameters and leave the aligned model still vulner-
able to attacks, raising the research question: Can
we precisely modify the toxic regions in LLMs
to achieve detoxification?
  Recent years have witnessed advancements in
knowledge editing methods designed for LLMs,
which facilitate efficient, post-training adjustments
to the models (Yao et al., 2023c; Mazzia et al.,
2023; Wang et al., 2023d; Zhang et al., 2024).
This technique focuses on specific areas for per-

**Abstract**Addressing the challenge of toxic language in online discussions is crucial for the development of effective toxicity detection models. This pioneering work focuses on addressing imbalanced datasets in toxicity detection by introducing a novel approach to augment toxic language data. We create a balanced dataset by instructing fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) using Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). Recognizing the challenges in collecting sufficient toxic samples from social media platforms for building a balanced dataset, our methodology involves sentence-level text data augmentation through paraphrasing existing samples using optimized generative LLMs. Leveraging generative LLM, we utilize the Proximal Policy Optimizer (PPO) as the RL algorithm to fine-tune the model further and align it with human feedback. In other words, we start by fine-tuning a LLM using an instruction dataset, specifically tailored for the task of paraphrasing while maintaining semantic consistency. Next, we apply PPO and a reward function, to further fine-tune (optimize) the instruction-tuned LLM. This RL process guides the model in generating toxic responses. We utilize the Google Perspective API as a toxicity evaluator to assess generated responses and assign rewards/penalties accordingly. This approach guides LLMs through PPO and the reward function, transforming minority class samples into augmented versions. The primary goal of our methodology is to create a balanced and diverse dataset to enhance the accuracy and performance of classifiers in identifying instances from the minority class. Utilizing two publicly available toxic datasets, we compared various techniques with our proposed method for generating toxic samples, demonstrating that our approach outperforms all others in producing a higher number of toxic samples. Starting with an initial 16,225 toxic prompts, our method successfully generated 122,951 toxic samples with a toxicity score exceeding 30%. Subsequently, we developed various classifiers using the generated balanced datasets and applied a cost-sensitive learning approach to the original imbalanced dataset. The findings highlight the superior performance of classifiers trained on data generated using our proposed method. These results highlight the importance of employing RL and a data-agnostic model as a reward mechanism for augmenting toxic data, thereby enhancing the robustness of toxicity detection models.","Bodaghi, Arezo, Fung, Benjamin C.

**Abstract**The aim of this work is to explore the forms of toxic behaviour that players encounter in competitive multiplayer real-time strategy (RTS) games. To this end, we carried out ethnographic observations and player interviews within the popular RTS game StarCraft II, and approached the data inductively, leading us to discover ten categories of toxic behaviour. While the harmfulness of toxic actions can be obtained as a product of severity and frequency, players’ assessment of the severity of toxic behaviors was contextualized by, (1) directly observed; (2) background; and (3) extraneous factors. Following our empirical findings, we derive a conceptual model for differentiating toxicity from mildly annoying and more severe behaviors. The discovered view of toxicity challenges the prevailing paradigm of treating players’ toxic behavior as a monolithic construct with a linear intensity spectrum. Instead, we advocate for a more granular approach, encouraging an understanding of the underlying dynamics behind negative online behaviors.","Laato, Samuli, Kordyaka, Bastian, Hamari, Juho",,,Traumatizing or Just Annoying?

While the harmfulness of toxic actions can be obtained as a product of severity and frequency, players’ assessment of the severity of toxic behaviors was contextualized by, (1) directly observed; (2) background; and (3) extraneous factors. Following our empirical findings, we derive a conceptual model for differentiating toxicity from mildly annoying and more severe behaviors. The discovered view of toxicity challenges the prevailing paradigm of treating players’ toxic behavior as a monolithic construct with a linear intensity spectrum. Instead, we advocate for a more granular approach, encouraging an understanding of the underlying dynamics behind negative online behaviors.",,,,, ,  Proceedings of the 2024 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,"Gamer communities, Gamification, Online games, Player behavior, Toxicity",detection,

**Abstract**Harmful textual content is pervasive on social media, poisoning online communities and negatively impacting participation. A common approach to this issue is developing detection models that rely on human annotations. However, the tasks required to build such models expose annotators to harmful and offensive content and may require significant time and cost to complete. Generative AI models have the potential to understand and detect harmful textual content. We used ChatGPT to investigate this potential and compared its performance with MTurker annotations for three frequently discussed concepts related to harmful textual content on social media: Hateful, Offensive, and Toxic (HOT). We designed five prompts to interact with ChatGPT and conducted four experiments eliciting HOT classifications. Our results show that ChatGPT can achieve an accuracy of approximately 80% when compared to MTurker annotations. Specifically, the model displays a more consistent classification for non-HOT comments than HOT comments compared to human annotations. Our findings also suggest that ChatGPT classifications align with the provided HOT definitions. However, ChatGPT classifies “hateful” and “offensive” as subsets of “toxic.” Moreover, the choice of prompts used to interact with ChatGPT impacts its performance. Based on these insights, our study provides several meaningful implications for employing ChatGPT to detect HOT content, particularly regarding the reliability and consistency of its performance, its understanding and reasoning of the HOT concept, and the impact of prompts on its performance.

**Abstract**To counter the side effect brought by the proliferation of social media platforms, hate speech detection (HSD) plays a vital role in halting the dissemination of toxic online posts at an early stage. However, given the ubiquitous topical communities on social media, a trained HSD classifier can easily become biased towards specific targeted groups (e.g.,female andblack people), where a high rate of either false positive or false negative results can significantly impair public trust in the fairness of content moderation mechanisms, and eventually harm the diversity of online society. Although existing fairness-aware HSD methods can smooth out some discrepancies across targeted groups, they are mostly specific to a narrow selection of targets that are assumed to be known and fixed. This inevitably prevents those methods from generalizing to real-world use cases where new targeted groups constantly emerge (e.g., new forums created on Reddit) over time. To tackle the defects of existing HSD practices, we propose &lt;u&gt;Ge&lt;/u&gt;neralizable &lt;u&gt;t&lt;/u&gt;arget-aware &lt;u&gt;Fair&lt;/u&gt;ness (GetFair), a new method for fairly classifying each post that contains diverse and even unseen targets during inference. To remove the HSD classifier's spurious dependence on target-related features, GetFair trains a series of filter functions in an adversarial pipeline, so as to deceive the discriminator that recovers the targeted group from filtered post embeddings. To maintain scalability and generalizability, we innovatively parameterize all filter functions via a hypernetwork. Taking a target's pretrained word embedding as input, the hypernetwork generates the weights used by each target-specific filter on-the-fly without storing dedicated filter parameters. In addition, a novel semantic gap alignment scheme is imposed on the generation process, such that the produced filter function for an unseen target is rectified by its semantic affinity with existing targets used for training. Finally, experiments are conducted on two benchmark HSD datasets, showing advantageous performance of GetFair on out-of-sample targets among baselines.","Chen, Tong, Wang, Danny, Liang, Xurong, Risius, Marten, Demartini, Gianluca, Yin, Hongzhi",,,Hate Speech Detection with Generalizable Target-aware Fairness,,,10.1145/3637528.3671821 , ,,"To counter the side effect brought by the proliferation of social media platforms, hate speech detection (HSD) plays a vital role in halting the dissemination of toxic online posts at an early stage.

**Abstract**Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased their remarkable capabilities in diverse domains, encompassing natural language understanding, translation, and even code generation. The potential for LLMs to generate harmful content is a significant concern. This risk necessitates rigorous testing and comprehensive evaluation of LLMs to ensure safe and responsible use. However, extensive testing of LLMs requires substantial computational resources, making it an expensive endeavor. Therefore, exploring cost-saving strategies during the testing phase is crucial to balance the need for thorough evaluation with the constraints of resource availability. To address this, our approach begins by transferring the moderation knowledge from an LLM to a small model. Subsequently, we deploy two distinct strategies for generating malicious queries: one based on a syntax tree approach, and the other leveraging an LLM-based method. Finally, our approach incorporates a sequential filter-test process designed to identify test cases that are prone to eliciting toxic responses. By doing so, we significantly curtail unnecessary or unproductive interactions with LLMs, thereby streamlining the testing process.

**Abstract**Warning: This paper contains examples of gender non-affirmative language which could be offensive, upsetting, and/or triggering. Transgender and non-binary (TGNB) individuals disproportionately experience discrimination and exclusion from daily life. Given the recent popularity and adoption of language generation technologies, the potential to further marginalize this population only grows. Although a multitude of NLP fairness literature focuses on illuminating and addressing gender biases, assessing gender harms for TGNB identities requires understanding how such identities uniquely interact with societal gender norms and how they differ from gender binary-centric perspectives. Such measurement frameworks inherently require centering TGNB voices to help guide the alignment between gender-inclusive NLP and whom they are intended to serve. Towards this goal, we ground our work in the TGNB community and existing interdisciplinary literature to assess how the social reality surrounding experienced marginalization of TGNB persons contributes to and persists within Open Language Generation (OLG).

To do this, we introduce TANGO, a dataset of template-based real-world text curated from a TGNB-oriented community. We discover a dominance of binary gender norms reflected by the models; LLMs least misgendered subjects in generated text when triggered by prompts whose subjects used binary pronouns. Meanwhile, misgendering was most prevalent when triggering generation with singular they and neopronouns.

**Abstract**The Web has become the main source for news acquisition. At the same time, news discussion has become more social: users can post comments on news articles or discuss news articles on other platforms like Reddit. These features empower and enable discussions among the users; however, they also act as the medium for the dissemination of toxic discourse and hate speech. The research community lacks a general understanding on what type of content attracts hateful discourse and the possible effects of social networks on the commenting activity on news articles. In this work, we perform a large-scale quantitative analysis of 125M comments posted on 412K news articles over the course of 19 months. We analyze the content of the collected articles and their comments using temporal analysis, user-based analysis, and linguistic analysis, to shed light on what elements attract hateful comments on news articles. We also investigate commenting activity when an article is posted on either 4chan’s Politically Incorrect board (/pol/) or six selected subreddits. We find statistically significant increases in hateful commenting activity around real-world divisive events like the “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville and political events like the second and third 2016 US presidential debates. Also, we find that articles that attract a substantial number of hateful comments have different linguistic characteristics when compared to articles that do not attract hateful comments. Furthermore, we observe that the post of a news articles on either /pol/ or the six subreddits is correlated with an increase of (hateful) commenting activity on the news articles.","Zannettou, Savvas, Elsherief, Mai, Belding, Elizabeth, Nilizadeh, Shirin, Stringhini, Gianluca",,,Measuring and Characterizing Hate Speech on News&nbsp;Websites,,,10.1145/3394231.3397902 , ,,"The Web has become the main source for news acquisition.

**Abstract**While large language models have demonstrated remarkable text generation capabilities, they often generate text with adverse or undesired attributes. Common approaches to control text generation involve refining models on data with desired properties or guiding language models decoding using an auxiliary model. However, these methods require additional training and extensive attribute-specific data. To further mitigate the training costs, we propose In-context learning Reward Guided Decoding (IRGD), a weighted decoding method that exploits the in-context learning ability of language models as an alternative to additional model fine-tuning. Specifically, IRGD utilizes ICL outputs to score the alignment reward between sequences and target attributes, subsequently modifying the sampling probabilities to favor tokens with higher reward scores. By applying ICL, IRGD adapts to different tasks by simply adjusting task descriptions and demonstration rather than fine-tuning the model. Through experiments on detoxification and sentiment control, we demonstrate the advantages of IRGD as a plug-and-play and fine-tuning-free decoding method that effectively balance attribute alignment and text quality.","Zhu, Xinyi, Zhou, Yanru, Song, Dandan, Yang, Ziyi",,,In-Context Learning Reward Guided Decoding for Controlled Text Generation,,,10.1109/ICSP62122.2024.10743861 , ,,"While large language models have demonstrated remarkable text generation capabilities, they often generate text with adverse or undesired attributes.

2958,"**Title**Forecasting the Spread of Toxicity on Twitter

**Abstract**In this paper, we explore the question of whether it is possible to forecast the spread of hate on Twitter. Unlike most prior work which models the spread of Twitter over a network with the goal of predicting the future “state” of a user (typically, as being “hateful” or not), here we are interested in how “hateful” (or toxic) the network as a whole becomes. We pose toxicity spread as a forecasting problem, and use ARIMA to find out whether the spread is forecastable. We find that toxicity spread is indeed forecasted by ARIMA. Given that it is forecastable, we ask two follow-up questions: (a) How well can we forecast it? and (b) What role, if any, does the structure of the retweet network play in forecasting? In order to answer these questions, we employ several techniques including Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolution Network (STGCN) and several variants of transformers. To determine the role that structure might play, we re-purpose the dataset in three ways: the network as a whole (the structure is ignored), communities interconnected with each other, and neighbourhoods of a set of individuals. Experiments with the network as a whole informs us how well we can forecast hate spread at a global level, while the latter experiments tell us whether and how network effects affect the forecasting. In an effort to tease out the effect of the network, we use two distinct techniques: STGCN, which requires the explicit connections in the form of a graph as input; and Transformers, where no explicit graph is given as input. Instead, we pose it as a multivariate analysis problem. We find that the PatchTST transformer performs the best at all levels. STGCN performs better than ARIMA suggesting that network structure matters. Somewhat interestingly, STGCN does not perform as well as PatchTST, suggesting that (a) PatchTST is able to implicitly learn the associations (flow of influence), and (b) the presence of explicit connections may not always imply influence.","Vaidya, Aatman, Nagar, Seema, Nanavati, Amit A.",,,Forecasting the Spread of Toxicity on Twitter,,,10.1109/CogMI58952.2023.00038 , ,,"In this paper, we explore the question of whether it is possible to forecast the spread of hate on Twitter.

**Abstract**Toxic comments can have a profoundly negative impact on online communities, fostering environments that feel unsafe, unwelcoming, and discouraging for participation. The task of toxic comment classification focuses on identifying and categorizing harmful or disruptive comments within online discussions. Despite extensive research in this area, several challenges persist, such as Multilingual Toxicity Detection, Data Imbalance, and Interpretability. Existing studies have categorized toxic comments into six distinct labels: toxic, severely toxic, obscene, threat, insult, and identity hate. Traditional machine learning models like SVM have achieved an accuracy of 87%, while more advanced models like BERT have reached up to 98.3%. The goal of this proposed work is to improve the identification of toxic comments across multiple social media platforms, particularly in datasets containing entries in multiple languages. To address this, deep learning models such as XLM-RoBERTa and BERT are employed to detect the language of the comment and classify it as either toxic or non-toxic. Each model’s performance will be evaluated primarily using Accuracy metrics, providing a basis for comparison to determine the most effective approach for multilingual toxic comment detection. High accuracy can be achieved through careful dataset preprocessing, advanced model architectures, and hyperparameter tuning.

But in addition to these advantages, there has been a noticeable rise in the spread of offensive and vulgar information. This is especially concerning because there are groups who deliberately make insulting remarks that target women, children, and the elderly in an effort to stifle peaceful speech. Even though there are reporting procedures in place, the lengthy process of filing complaints deters many users from doing so. Our research provides an automatic method made to identify, report, and delete offensive communications from the Telegram social media platform in order to address this problem. Some previous work to classify comments is already present. But it is only on English language. In this work, we are extending this to Malayalam, Manglish (Malayalam language written with English letters), Mixed (mix of Malayalam and Manglish) and English Languages. Apart from the above two, we have created a Hybrid Deep Learning model combining CNN and RNN and compared its performance with already existing models like Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN and BERT. Our project aims to create an open and courteous online community where meaningful conversations can flourish without the constant influence of offensive language by tackling toxic communication at its source. This automatic approach is a big step in the direction of making Telegram a happier and more encouraging place for users to interact online.","Prithvi, P., B, Abhijith A",,,"Toxic Chat Synthesis, Reporting and Removing in Social Media using Hybrid Deep Learning Model",,,10.1109/ICICEC62498.2024.10808410 , ,,"Following the COVID-19 epidemic, social media usage has increased dramatically among a wide range of users, from young people to the elderly.

**Abstract**The extensive adoption of internet platforms such as YouTube has transformed communication and information exchange, compelling people to share their opinions and participate in global conversations. Open communication can, however, also encourage the spread of offensive material, such as remarks that are derogatory or involve threats or hate speech. Such offensive remarks have the potential to damage users' mental health by fostering a hostile and unsafe environment that discourages meaningful relationships. We introduce DeTox, a web application that uses machine learning techniques to detect and eliminate harmful comments from YouTube videos in order to address this problem. For the purpose of classifying comments, DeTox uses ML and DL models, which guarantees precise identification of harmful content. The YouTube Data API is integrated by the system to retrieve comments from specific videos and eliminate any harmful remarks found. A detailed examination of the Toxic Comment Classification Challenge dataset, made available by Kaggle, was necessary for the development of DeTox. To find common patterns in hazardous language, preprocessing and examination of the data were done in order to examine the distribution of toxic and non-toxic remarks. FastAPI is a high-level Python web framework that makes web application development easier and is used by the DeTox online application.

Such issues led to growing research on text detoxification systems that can automatically rewrite toxic content. A systematic evaluation is required to ensure these systems produce high-quality detoxified text that modifies the original text to be non-toxic while preserving its content.

A new MT approach focused on data validation showed that MRs incorporated with tools can be used to identify defects in machine translation services.

**Abstract**Automatic detection methods for toxic speech can potentially curb the dissemination of offensive, abusive, hateful, and other toxic speech on social media. However, these methods often show bias by overreacting to words such as identity terms, profanity, and swear words that occur in non-toxic speech and erroneously classifying them as toxic speech. Recent research has attempted to regularise relevant biased words in predefined lexicons to mitigate their impact on model classification. However, this approach faces two challenges. Firstly, words such as pro-fanity and swear words in biased words play a crucial role in the model's ability to identify toxic speech, and excessive suppression of these words using regularization methods can detrimentally affect the performance of the classification model. Secondly, due to the limitations of regularization techniques, existing methods rely on manually constructed biased word dictionaries, which can only mitigate bias associated with identity-related terms. This bias should not significantly impact hate speech prediction. It is challenging to encompass lexical biases such as profanity and swear words that are specific to different datasets beyond identity terms To address the above challenges, this paper proposes a novel feature attribution-guided contrastive learning method. The method consists of two repeated steps across epochs. In each epoch, first identifies keywords in sentences that are crucial for predicting toxicity through feature attribution. Then it applies contrastive learning to separate samples that have common toxic keywords but different labels.

3036,"**Title**Large Language Models: Ethics and Norms in the European Union

**Abstract**This paper investigates the ethical-legal issues underlying the implementation of Large Language Models, in the aftermath of the European Union Parliament's approval of the Artificial Intelligence Regulation. In very recent years, there has been a rapid evolution and multiform implementation of the so-called Artificial Intelligence. Notably, one significant development in AI is the creation of systems capable of performing tasks based on a set of established rules. Artificial Intelligence has recently undergone a significant revolution that has led to a radical paradigm shift, represented by the so-called Foundation Models, which have two main characteristics: emergence and homogenisation. On the other hand, Language Modelling (LM) is one of the main approaches to advance the linguistic intelligence of machines and thus a Foundation Model trained on textual data.

**Abstract**As the world continues to evolve, technology has proven to be a necessity in the lives of everyone. Evolving beyond professional use, cyberspace is now populated by online communities being used for communication, learning, and entertainment. However, the increased online presence exposes users to a variety of cultures, personalities, and levels of maturity. Some may also seek to cause harm to others through cyberbullying or may display toxic behaviors. This research aims to tackle the growing problem of toxicity and harassment in online environments. The proposed solution will utilize Artificial Intelligence (AI), and more specifically Natural Language Processing (NLP), to moderate communication and detect malicious language and behavior. The efforts shared in this paper specifically present a work-in-progress. For the time being, two models have been tested with a single dataset from Twitter: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).

**Abstract**The internet has led to a significant increase in the amount of information available, which has resulted in the rise of online communication among users. Unfortunately, this has also resulted in the proliferation of toxic online texts, which can lead to bullying, harassment, and personal attacks. While there have been attempts to develop efficient models for predicting toxic comments online, the field is still in its nascent stage, hence new frameworks and strategies are needed to address this issue. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a promising solution for text classification due to recent advancements in hardware and big data management. Additionally, the increasing amount of data available necessitates the development of novel machine learning tools for managing this information. This study compares CNNs with the traditional bag-of-words approach as well as more efficient methods for text classification.

**Abstract**In modern times, the use of the internet and social media has greatly increased, leading to the emergence of online toxicity, which can have serious consequences for individuals' mental health. Machine learning techniques can be used to detect mental health issues and address online toxicity. One approach to detecting mental health issues in its early stages is to use machine learning to analyze social media posts and other online content. By training a model on large datasets of labeled text, it is possible to identify patterns and indicators of mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and stress. To address online toxicity, machine learning can be used to identify and classify toxic content, such as hate speech or cyberbullying. This can be done by training a model on a dataset of labeled toxic and non-toxic content Once the model is trained, it can be used to identify and flag the toxic content in real-time, allowing it to be moderated or removed completely.

We analyze the result from two aspects and conclude that the task and data of pre-training are important to PLM. Seeing that BERT is less effective than DeepMoji, it is possible to improve the performance of BERT. We then propose a “Knowledge Extension” method to improve the performance of the BERT model.

**Abstract**Agrochemicals are to be blamed for the poisoning of millions of human beings worldwide, with acute and chronic exposure to such substances causing thousands of deaths. The presence of agrochemicals in the air is caused by drift—a phenomenon that originates from ground and aerial spraying applied in lands used for agribusiness. Drift refers to the spread and wind-driven transport of agrochemicals that have been volatilized during spraying, and which can easily reach towns and cities. Actively monitoring agrochemical drift is essential to protect the health of citizens and the environment. Many of the systems used for monitoring agrochemicals are currently analog, while those with some degree of digitalization are expensive, complex, and not easily scalable. Therefore, new cost-effective, stand-alone, reliable, easy-to-implement, and citizen-oriented technological tools need to be designed and developed. This article introduces “DriftGLY,” an innovative, low-cost Internet of Things (IoT) early warning system that utilizes a digital traffic light to continuously and automatically monitor the presence of agrochemicals in the air, both individually and in cocktail form. The key innovation of DriftGLY lies in the close relationship between the configuration of its digital traffic light and the precise calculation of the quantity of agrochemicals deposited in spray tanks. This configuration is specifically based on the parameter of the dose rate expressed in liters per hectare of these contaminants. DriftGLY incorporates an original collection system that allows for the indirect detection of agrochemicals in their particulate, gaseous, and, unlike traditional systems, liquid forms. In this manner, DriftGLY displays pollution risk levels through its digital traffic light, transmitting them to an IoT platform via various connectivity options, such as WiFi, LoRaWAN, and GSM/GPRS, and posts them on the social network X (formerly known as Twitter).

**Abstract**The rapid expansion of online communities and social media platforms, the issue of toxic comments has become increasingly prevalent. Toxic comments not only contribute to a negative user experience but also have the potential to propagate hate speech, harassment, and cyberbullies. Therefore, there is a pressing need for robust and efficient comment toxicity detection systems that can automatically identify and flag toxic comments. The proposed methodology involves preprocessing the data-set by removing punctuation, applying stemming and lemmatization techniques to standardize the text. The data is then transformed into a matrix representation using tokenization, padding, and word embedding techniques. In the word embedding phase, three popular algorithms, namely Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText, are compared to determine the most suitable approach for capturing the semantic meaning of words. The architectural design comprises several layers, encompassing an embedding layer, bidirectional LSTM layer, dropout layers, and dense layers. The bidirectional LSTM layer plays a crucial role in assimilating contextual information from both preceding and subsequent words within the comment. Training involves utilizing the training set, followed by evaluation. This project addresses the crucial need for comment toxicity detection and provides an effective methodology for identifying toxic comments in online platforms.

**Abstract**The U.S. Capitol riot increased scholarly interest in the relationship between online platforms and domestic extremism. This study utilized text mining methods such as LDA topic modeling and toxicity analysis to assess the prominent narratives disseminated by influential far-right accounts on three social media platforms around the riot timeframe. We utilized a novel categorization system to classify topic streams into narrative frames. Parler posts contained the greatest conspiratorial content and cross-platform content sharing. Twitter was found to have a small number of far-right accounts that actively disseminate extremist views. YouTube far-right influencers produced the highest number of videos related to racial topics. Parler posts demonstrated a strong association between toxicity measures and current trending topics. A few mentions of far-right accounts within the top 20 topic streams, reveal that extreme racial and nationalist ideologies are active on the Twitter platform, even though overall toxicity was low. Our YouTube data was seeded by far-right accounts, and therefore, not surprisingly, the content was revealed to contain a high degree of racially-charged discourse. Our analysis revealed, however, that the YouTube data was also characterized by a high level of toxicity coming from both creators and commenters. Both Parler and YouTube demonstrated that some far-right content creators were able to drive up the toxicity of the discourse. These results attest to the impact social media influencers have on online discourse. Interestingly, however, the toxicity scores for related YouTube videos remained low, suggesting that the video-promotion algorithm does not necessarily increase exposure to radical content.","Mead, Esther L., McNerney, Hillary W., Agarwal, Nitin",,,Text Mining Domestic Extremism Topics on Multiple Social Media Platforms,,,10.1109/CLNLP64123.2024.00028 , ,,"The U.S. Capitol riot increased scholarly interest in the relationship between online platforms and domestic extremism.

**Abstract**Multitask learning has been thoroughly proven to improve the generalization performance given a set of related tasks. Most multitask learning algorithm assume that all tasks are related. However, if all the tasks are not related, negative transfer of information occurs amongst the tasks, and the performance of traditional multitask learning algorithm worsens. Thus, we design an algorithm that simultaneously groups the related tasks and trains only the related task together. There are different approaches to train the related tasks in multi-task learning based on which information is shared across the tasks. These approaches either assume that the parameters of each of the tasks are situated close together, or assume that there is a common underlying latent space in the features of the tasks that is related. Most multi-task learning algorithm use either regularization method or matrix-variate priors. In our algorithm, the related tasks are tied together by a set of common features selected by each tasks. Thus, to train the related tasks together, we use spike and slab prior to select a common set of features for the related tasks, and a mixture of gaussians prior to select the set of related tasks. For validation, the developed algorithm is tested on toxicity prediction and hand written digit recognition data sets. The results show a significant improvement over multitask learning with feature selection for larger number of tasks.

**Abstract**Because of online communication, e-commerce, and digital devices, text data—especially short text—permeates every aspect of our life in the digital age. However, this transformation has also unveiled a darker side - the prevalence of harmful, offensive, and toxic comments, including hate speech and harassment. The integrity of online groups, social harmony, and individual safety are all gravely threatened by this toxin. In this work, we examine the effectiveness of two recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures, namely Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), for the classification of damaging comments. These models are evaluated using key metrics such as F1-score, recall, accuracy, and precision.

**Abstract**Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in numerous applications. It is hence important to ensure that their ethical standard aligns with humans’. However, existing jail-breaking efforts show that such alignment could be compromised by well-crafted prompts. In this paper, we disclose a new threat to LLMs alignment when a malicious actor has access to the top-k token predictions at each output position of the model, such as in all open-source LLMs and many commercial LLMs that provide the needed APIs (e.g., some GPT versions). It does not require crafting any prompt. Instead, it leverages the observation that even when an LLM declines a toxic query, the harmful response is concealed deep within the output logits. We can coerce the model to disclose it by forcefully using low-ranked output tokens during auto-regressive output generation, and such forcing is only needed in a very small number of selected output positions. We call it model interrogation. Since our method operates differently from jail-breaking, it has better effectiveness than state-of-the- art jail-breaking techniques (92% versus 62%) and is 10 to 20 times faster. The toxic content elicited by our method is also of better quality. More importantly, it is complementary to jail-breaking, and a synergetic integration of the two exhibits superior performance over individual methods. We also find that with interrogation, harmful content can even be extracted from models customized for coding tasks.","Zhang, Zhuo, Shen, Guangyu, Tao, Guanhong, Cheng, Siyuan, Zhang, Xiangyu",,,On Large Language Models’ Resilience to Coercive Interrogation,,,10.1109/SP54263.2024.00208 , ,,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in numerous applications.

**Abstract**Racism and intolerance on social media contribute to a toxic online environment which may spill offline to foster hatred, and eventually lead to physical violence. That is the case with online antisemitism, the specific category of hatred considered in this study. Tracking antisemitic themes and their associated terminology over time in online discussions could help monitor the sentiments of their participants and their evolution, and possibly offer avenues for intervention that may prevent the escalation of hatred.

Instead, we propose an automated method that extracts antisemitic themes and terminology from extremist social media over time and captures their evolution. Since supervised learning would be too limited for such a task, we created an unsupervised online machine learning approach that uses large language models to assess the contextual similarity of posts. The method clusters similar posts together, dividing, and creating additional clusters over time when subthemes emerge from existing ones or new themes appear. The antisemitic terminology used within each theme is extracted from the posts in each cluster.

**Abstract**Recent research has shown that large-scale pretrained language models, specifically transformers, tend to exhibit issues relating to racism, sexism, religion bias, and toxicity in general. Unfortunately, these pretrained language models are used almost universally in downstream tasks, and natural language processing is often applied to make real-world predictions. Thus, debiasing these language models as early in development as possible is increasingly crucial for preventing unintentional harms caused by natural language systems. To this end, we propose a new technique called partitioned contrastive gradient unlearning (PCGU), a gray-box method for debiasing pretrained masked language models. PCGU aims to optimize only the weights that contribute most to a specific domain of bias, doing so by computing a first-order approximation based on the gradients of contrastive sentence pairs. Our experiments show that PCGU is both low-cost and seems particularly effective at pinpointing the sources of implicit social bias in large pretrained transformers. Although we train using PCGU in the gender-profession domain only, we find that doing so can also partially mitigate bias across other domains.

**Abstract**Large language models (LM) based on Transformers allow to generate plausible long texts.

This approach, in addition to being easier and cheaper to train than fine-tuning the LM, allows to apply the constraint more finely and dynamically. We propose several original methods to search this generation tree, notably the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) which provides theoretical guarantees on the search efficiency, but also simpler methods based on re-ranking a pool of diverse sequences using the discriminator scores. These methods are evaluated, with automatic and human-based metrics, on two types of constraints and languages: review polarity and emotion control in French and English. We show that discriminator-guided MCTS decoding achieves state-of-the-art results without having to tune the language model, in both tasks and languages.

However, these methods often compromised the integrity of the language model`s decoding process, resulting in less smooth text generation.Alternatively, other techniques utilized multiple attribute prompts to align the generated text with desired attributes, but this approach required prompt design for each attribute and was dependent on the size of the language model.

**Abstract**Pretrained neural language models (LMs) are prone to generating racist, sexist, or otherwise toxic language which hinders their safe deployment. We investigate the extent to which pretrained LMs can be prompted to generate toxic language, and the effectiveness of controllable text generation algorithms at preventing such toxic degeneration. We create and release RealToxicityPrompts, a dataset of 100K naturally occurring, sentence-level prompts derived from a large corpus of English web text, paired with toxicity scores from a widely-used toxicity classifier. Using RealToxicityPrompts, we find that pretrained LMs can degenerate into toxic text even from seemingly innocuous prompts. We empirically assess several controllable generation methods, and find that while data- or compute-intensive methods (e.g., adaptive pretraining on non-toxic data) are more effective at steering away from toxicity than simpler solutions (e.g., banning {\textquotedblleft}bad{\textquotedblright} words), no current method is failsafe against neural toxic degeneration. To pinpoint the potential cause of such persistent toxic degeneration, we analyze two web text corpora used to pretrain several LMs (including GPT-2; Radford et. al, 2019), and find a significant amount of offensive, factually unreliable, and otherwise toxic content.

Yet, LLMs have a tendency to devolve into toxic degeneration, wherein otherwise safe and unproblematic models begin generating toxic content. For the sake of social responsibility and inspired by the biological mechanisms of inhibition control, we introduce the paradigm of Education for Societal Norms (ESN). By collecting and labeling examples as acceptable and unacceptable (in this case toxic and non-toxic), and including a corresponding acceptable rewrite with every unacceptable example, we introduce a new mechanism for LLM detoxification. We annotate a dataset of 2,850 entries and use it to fine-tune a model, which we call a Model with Inhibition Control (MICo). Evaluating this model on toxicity detection capability, rewrite detoxification, meaning preservation, and overall toxicity reduction, we discover significant improvements over the baseline model. In our experiments we show that overall toxicity of this model is more than 60{\%} reduced, with over 75{\%} reduction in severe toxicity.","Siegelmann, Roy, Mehrabi, Ninareh, Goyal, Palash, Goyal, Prasoon, Bauer, Lisa, Dhamala, Jwala, Galstyan, Aram, Gupta, Rahul, Ghanadan, Reza",,,{MIC}o: Preventative Detoxification of Large Language Models through Inhibition Control,,,10.18653/v1/2024.findings-naacl.110 , ,,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful tools which have been both dominant and commonplace in the field of Artificial Intelligence.

**Abstract**Toxicity detection plays a crucial role in maintaining the peace of the society. Existing methods can be roughly categorized as small language model (SLM) based and large language model (LLM) based. However, due to the limitation of SLMs on general knowledge and the potential embedded bias in LLMs despite their large amount of knowledge, it is not a good idea to detect toxicity only with either SLM or LLM based method.In this work, we propose to implant LLM`s knowledge into SLM based methods such that we can stick to both types of models' strengths. To this end, we develop a reading comprehension (RC) tree to transfer knowledge between two models. Specifically, we first construct the RC tree, from an extensive to intensive reading perspective, to capture the local and global information in the text. We then model samples encoded by SLM and knowledge extracted from LLM as two distributions using the constructed RT tree. We finally transfer knowledge via optimal transportation between two distributions.

**Abstract**Despite the recent successes of transformer-based models in terms of effectiveness on a variety of tasks, their decisions often remain opaque to humans. Explanations are particularly important for tasks like offensive language or toxicity detection on social media because a manual appeal process is often in place to dispute automatically flagged content.

3419,"**Title**{COUNT}: {CO}ntrastive {UN}likelihood Text Style Transfer for Text Detoxification

**Abstract**Offensive and toxic text on social media platforms can lead to polarization and divisiveness within online communities and hinders constructive dialogue. Text detoxification is a crucial task in natural language processing to ensure the generation of non-toxic and safe text. Text detoxification is a special case of the Text Style Transfer (TST) problem, where an input text is rephrased to an output text that preserves its content while modifying the style (in this case to a more neutral, non-toxic style). State-of-the-art methods for detoxification use supervised training of encoder-decoder models to produce gold-standard outputs with a standard likelihood-based objective. However, it can be hard for these models to deviate from their pretrained auto-encoder identity mapping. While previous methods have used unlikelihood-based losses to penalize input-to-output copying of toxic content, these methods also unfortunately penalize non-toxic content in the input that would be fine to preserve in the output. To address these issues, we introduce a novel contrastive unlikelihood objective (COUNT) that directly contrasts the gold standard rephrasing with the identity input-to-output mapping to effectively isolate and focus learning on non-toxic style transfer.

Text detoxification is a special case of the Text Style Transfer (TST) problem, where an input text is rephrased to an output text that preserves its content while modifying the style (in this case to a more neutral, non-toxic style). State-of-the-art methods for detoxification use supervised training of encoder-decoder models to produce gold-standard outputs with a standard likelihood-based objective. However, it can be hard for these models to deviate from their pretrained auto-encoder identity mapping. While previous methods have used unlikelihood-based losses to penalize input-to-output copying of toxic content, these methods also unfortunately penalize non-toxic content in the input that would be fine to preserve in the output. To address these issues, we introduce a novel contrastive unlikelihood objective (COUNT) that directly contrasts the gold standard rephrasing with the identity input-to-output mapping to effectively isolate and focus learning on non-toxic style transfer. We benchmark COUNT on two parallel datasets, ParaDetox and APPDIA, showing that it achieves significant improvements in jointly combined fluency, content preservation, and detoxification (i.e., the highest {\textquotedblleft}J{\textquotedblright} score).",,,,, ,  Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EMNLP 2023,,detox,

**Abstract**Steering language generation towards objectives or away from undesired content has been a long-standing goal in utilizing language models (LM). Recent work has demonstrated reinforcement learning and weighted decoding as effective approaches to achieve a higher level of language control and quality with pros and cons. In this work, we propose a novel critic decoding method for controlled language generation (CriticControl) that combines the strengths of reinforcement learning and weighted decoding. Specifically, we adopt the actor-critic framework and train an LM-steering critic from reward models. Similar to weighted decoding, our method freezes the language model and manipulates the output token distribution using a critic to improve training efficiency and stability. Evaluation of our method on three controlled generation tasks, topic control, sentiment control, and detoxification, shows that our approach generates more coherent and well-controlled texts than previous methods.

**Abstract**Text detoxification is a conditional text generation task aiming to remove offensive content from toxic text.

Intuitively, there are diverse ways to detoxify sentences while preserving their meanings, and we can select from detoxified sentences before displaying text to users.

The conditional model takes toxic text as the condition and reduces its toxicity, yielding a diverse set of detoxified sentences.

**Abstract**The proliferation of social media has increased the visibility and effects of hate speech. To address this, NLP solutions have been developed to identify both explicit and implicit forms of hate speech. Typically, these approaches evaluate the toxicity of utterances in isolation, ignoring the context. Drawing on pragmatics, our study examines how contextual factors can influence the perceived toxicity of utterances, thereby anchoring assessments in a more nuanced semantic framework. We present Toximatics, a dataset that includes context-dependent utterances and it`s toxicity score. We also introduce a novel synthetic data generation pipeline designed to create context-utterance pairs at scale with controlled polarity. This pipeline can enhance existing hate speech datasets by adding contextual information to utterances, either preserving or altering their polarity, and also generate completely new pairs from seed statements. We utilised both features to create Toximatics. To address biases in state-of-the-art hate datasets, which often skew towards specific sensitive topics such as politics, race, and gender, we propose a method to generate neutral utterances typical of various social settings. These are then contextualized to show how neutrality can shift to toxicity or benignity depending on the surrounding context.

As an essential branch of toxic language, this type of language exacerbates conflicts and confrontations among Internet communities and detrimentally impacts disadvantaged groups. Traditional pre-trained language models (PLMs) perform poorly in detecting PCL due to its implicit toxicity traits like hypocrisy and false sympathy. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), we can harness their rich emotional semantics to establish a paradigm for exploring implicit toxicity. In this paper, we introduce PclGPT, a comprehensive LLM benchmark designed specifically for PCL. We collect, annotate, and integrate the Pcl-PT/SFT dataset, and then develop a bilingual PclGPT-EN/CN model group through a comprehensive pre-training and supervised fine-tuning staircase process to facilitate implicit toxic detection. Group detection results and fine-grained detection from PclGPT and other models reveal significant variations in the degree of bias in PCL towards different vulnerable groups, necessitating increased societal attention to protect them.","Wang, Hongbo, LiMingDa, LiMingDa, Lu, Junyu, Xia, Hebin, Yang, Liang, Xu, Bo, Liu, Ruizhu, Lin, Hongfei",,,{P}cl{GPT}: A Large Language Model for Patronizing and Condescending Language Detection,,,10.18653/v1/2024.findings-emnlp.406 , ,,"Disclaimer: Samples in this paper may be harmful and cause discomfort!

**Abstract**Detoxifying multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) has become crucial due to their increasing global use. In this work, we explore zero-shot cross-lingual generalization of preference tuning in detoxifying LLMs. Unlike previous studies that show limited cross-lingual generalization for other safety tasks, we demonstrate that Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training with only English data can significantly reduce toxicity in multilingual open-ended generations. For example, the probability of mGPT-1.3B generating toxic continuations drops from 46.8{\%} to 3.9{\%} across 17 different languages after training. Our results also extend to other multilingual LLMs, such as BLOOM, Llama3, and Aya-23. Using mechanistic interpretability tools like causal intervention and activation analysis, we identified the dual multilinguality property of MLP layers in LLMs, which explains the cross-lingual generalization of DPO.

We examine a wide spectrum of LLM compression techniques, including unstructured pruning, semi-structured pruning, and quantization. Our analysis reveals that compression can lead to unexpected consequences. Although compression may unintentionally alleviate LLMs' degeneration harm, it can still exacerbate representational harm.

**Abstract**Recently, tremendous strides have been made to align the generation of Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values to mitigate toxic or unhelpful content.

**Abstract**Direct preference optimization (DPO) is a successful fine-tuning strategy for aligning large language models with human preferences without the need to train a reward model or employ reinforcement learning. DPO, as originally formulated, relies on binary preference data and fine-tunes a language model to increase the likelihood of a preferred response over a dispreferred response. However, not all preference pairs are equal. Sometimes, the preferred response is only slightly better than the dispreferred one. In other cases, the preference is much stronger. For instance, if a response contains harmful or toxic content, the annotator will have a strong preference for that response. In this paper, we propose a generalization of DPO, termed DPO with an offset (ODPO), that does not treat every preference pair equally during fine-tuning. Intuitively, ODPO requires the difference between the likelihood of the preferred and dispreferred response to be greater than an offset value. The offset is determined based on the extent to which one response is preferred over another. Our experiments on various tasks suggest that ODPO significantly outperforms DPO in aligning language models, especially when the number of preference pairs is limited.","Amini, Afra, Vieira, Tim, Cotterell, Ryan",,,Direct Preference Optimization with an Offset,,,10.18653/v1/2024.findings-acl.592 , ,,"Direct preference optimization (DPO) is a successful fine-tuning strategy for aligning large language models with human preferences without the need to train a reward model or employ reinforcement learning.

**Abstract**Text style transfer (TST) aims to modify the style of a text without altering its original meaning. Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate superior performance across multiple tasks, including TST. However, in zero-shot setups, they tend to directly copy a significant portion of the input text to the output without effectively changing its style. To enhance the stylistic variety and fluency of the text, we present sNeuron-TST, a novel approach for steering LLMs using style-specific neurons in TST. Specifically, we identify neurons associated with the source and target styles and deactivate source-style-only neurons to give target-style words a higher probability, aiming to enhance the stylistic diversity of the generated text. However, we find that this deactivation negatively impacts the fluency of the generated text, which we address by proposing an improved contrastive decoding method that accounts for rapid token probability shifts across layers caused by deactivated source-style neurons.

**Abstract**Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of producing content that perpetuates stereotypes, discrimination, and toxicity.The recently proposed \textit{moral self-correction} is a computationally efficient method for reducing harmful content in the responses of LLMs. However, the process of how injecting self-correction instructions can modify the behavior of LLMs remains under-explored.

(3) Is intrinsic moral self-correction actually superficial in terms of reduced immorality in hidden states?

**Abstract**Model alignment with human preferences is an essential step in making Large Language Models (LLMs) helpful and consistent with human values. It typically consists of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) stages. However, RLHF faces inherent limitations stemming from a complex training setup and its tendency to align the model with implicit values that end users cannot control at run-time. Moreover, reward models in RLHF stage commonly rely on single-dimensional feedback as opposed to explicit, multifaceted signals that indicate attributes such as helpfulness, humor, and toxicity. To address these limitations, we propose SteerLM, a supervised fine-tuning method that empowers end-users to control responses during inference. SteerLM conditions responses to conform to an explicitly defined multi-dimensional set of attributes, thereby empowering a steerable AI capable of generating helpful and high-quality responses while maintaining customizability. Experiments show that SteerLM trained on open source datasets generates responses that are preferred by human and automatic evaluators to many state-of-the-art baselines trained with RLHF while being much easier to train.

**Abstract**As generative large language models (LLMs) grow more performant and prevalent, we must develop comprehensive enough tools to measure and improve their fairness. Different prompt-based datasets can be used to measure social bias across multiple text domains and demographic axes, meaning that testing LLMs on more datasets can potentially help us characterize their biases more fully, and better ensure equal and equitable treatment of marginalized demographic groups. In this work, our focus is two-fold: (1) Benchmarking: a comparison of 6 different prompt-based bias and toxicity metrics across 12 demographic axes and 5 families of generative LLMs. Out of those 6 metrics, AdvPromptSet and HolisticBiasR are novel datasets proposed in the paper. The comparison of those benchmarks gives us insights about the bias and toxicity of the compared models. Therefore, we explore the frequency of demographic terms in common LLM pre-training corpora and how this may relate to model biases. (2) Mitigation: we conduct a comprehensive study of how well 3 bias/toxicity mitigation techniques perform across our suite of measurements.

**Abstract**While large language models have proven effective in a huge range of downstream applications, they often generate text that is problematic or lacks a desired attribute. In this paper, we introduce Reward-Augmented Decoding (RAD), a text generation procedure that uses a small unidirectional reward model to encourage a language model to generate text that has certain properties. Specifically, RAD uses the reward model to score generations as they are produced and rescales sampling probabilities to favor high-reward tokens. By using a unidirectional reward model, RAD can cache activations from prior generation steps to decrease computational overhead. Through experiments on generating non-toxic and sentiment-controlled text, we demonstrate that RAD performs best among methods that change only the generation procedure and matches the performance of state-of-the-art methods that involve re-training the language model. We further validate that RAD is effective on very large language models while incurring a minimal computational overhead.","Deng, Haikang, Raffel, Colin",,,Reward-Augmented Decoding: Efficient Controlled Text Generation With a Unidirectional Reward Model,,,10.18653/v1/2023.emnlp-main.721 , ,,"While large language models have proven effective in a huge range of downstream applications, they often generate text that is problematic or lacks a desired attribute.

    guage detection enabling joint intent classiﬁ-

    core task of Natural Language Understanding
   (NLU). The dataset consists of 45K utterances

1  Introduction

As the popularity of multi-player online games has
grown, the phenomenon of in-game toxic behav-
ior has taken root within them. Toxic behavior
is strongly present in recent online games and is
problematic to the gaming industry (Adinolf and
Turkay, 2018). For instance, 74% of US players of
such games report harassment with 65% experienc-
ing severe harassment. (ADL, 2019).
   In the past few years, Natural Language Process-
ing (NLP) researchers have proposed several on-
line game/community toxicity analysis frameworks

(Kwak et al., 2015; Murnion et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2020) and datasets (M¨artens et al., 2015;
Stoop et al., 2019). However, existing datasets
(1) focus only on the single utterance level with-
out deeper understanding of context in the whole
conversation/chat, and (2) do not explicitly use se-
mantic clues from the words within the utterance.
  The chat in online games and communities is
similar in nature to spoken language, an area stud-
ied by Natural Language Understanding (NLU).
NLU research aims to best represent human com-
munication by extracting semantic structure in the
form of intent and slot analysis. Intent detection is
the classiﬁcation of the desired outcome of an utter-
ance (or sentence), and slot ﬁlling is the labeling of
each token (or word) in the utterance with the type

1  Introduction

As the popularity of multi-player online games has
grown, the phenomenon of in-game toxic behav-
ior has taken root within them. Toxic behavior
is strongly present in recent online games and is
problematic to the gaming industry (Adinolf and
Turkay, 2018). For instance, 74% of US players of
such games report harassment with 65% experienc-
ing severe harassment. (ADL, 2019).
   In the past few years, Natural Language Process-
ing (NLP) researchers have proposed several on-
line game/community toxicity analysis frameworks

(Kwak et al., 2015; Murnion et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2020) and datasets (M¨artens et al., 2015;
Stoop et al., 2019). However, existing datasets
(1) focus only on the single utterance level with-
out deeper understanding of context in the whole
conversation/chat, and (2) do not explicitly use se-
mantic clues from the words within the utterance.
  The chat in online games and communities is
similar in nature to spoken language, an area stud-
ied by Natural Language Understanding (NLU).
NLU research aims to best represent human com-
munication by extracting semantic structure in the
form of intent and slot analysis. Intent detection is
the classiﬁcation of the desired outcome of an utter-
ance (or sentence), and slot ﬁlling is the labeling of
each token (or word) in the utterance with the type
of semantic information it carries. In recent litera-
ture, these two tasks are trained jointly to capture
synergies between them, and these jointly trained
models give better results (Zhang et al., 2019b).
Furthermore, researchers have made available joint
task datasets that contain the context of a multi-turn
conversation (Budzianowski et al., 2018; Schuster
et al., 2019)

**Abstract**Toxic language detection systems often falsely flag text that contains minority group mentions as toxic, as those groups are often the targets of online hate. Such over-reliance on spurious correlations also causes systems to struggle with detecting implicitly toxic language. To help mitigate these issues, we create ToxiGen, a new large-scale and machine-generated dataset of 274k toxic and benign statements about 13 minority groups. We develop a demonstration-based prompting framework and an adversarial classifier-in-the-loop decoding method to generate subtly toxic and benign text with a massive pretrained language model. Controlling machine generation in this way allows ToxiGen to cover implicitly toxic text at a larger scale, and about more demographic groups, than previous resources of human-written text. We conduct a human evaluation on a challenging subset of ToxiGen and find that annotators struggle to distinguish machine-generated text from human-written language. We also find that 94.5{\%} of toxic examples are labeled as hate speech by human annotators. Using three publicly-available datasets, we show that finetuning a toxicity classifier on our data improves its performance on human-written data substantially.

We develop a demonstration-based prompting framework and an adversarial classifier-in-the-loop decoding method to generate subtly toxic and benign text with a massive pretrained language model. Controlling machine generation in this way allows ToxiGen to cover implicitly toxic text at a larger scale, and about more demographic groups, than previous resources of human-written text. We conduct a human evaluation on a challenging subset of ToxiGen and find that annotators struggle to distinguish machine-generated text from human-written language. We also find that 94.5{\%} of toxic examples are labeled as hate speech by human annotators.

**Abstract**In the task of hate speech detection, there exists a high correlation between African American English (AAE) and annotators' perceptions of toxicity in current datasets.

We test our approach by debiasing toxicity classifiers built using 5 neural models (multi layer perceptron model and masked language models) and 3 datasets in a 4 communities setting. We also explore 4 different obfuscators for debiasing. Results demonstrate the merits of our approach: bias is reduced for almost all of our runs without sacrificing false positive rates or F1 scores for minority or majority communities.

**Abstract**Supervised classification heavily depends on datasets annotated by humans. However, in subjective tasks such as toxicity classification, these annotations often exhibit low agreement among raters. Annotations have commonly been aggregated by employing methods like majority voting to determine a single ground truth label. In subjective tasks, aggregating labels will result in biased labeling and, consequently, biased models that can overlook minority opinions. Previous studies have shed light on the pitfalls of label aggregation and have introduced a handful of practical approaches to tackle this issue. Recently proposed multi-annotator models, which predict labels individually per annotator, are vulnerable to under-determination for annotators with few samples. This problem is exacerbated in crowdsourced datasets. In this work, we propose Annotator Aware Representations for Texts (AART) for subjective classification tasks. Our approach involves learning representations of annotators, allowing for exploration of annotation behaviors.

We followed a standard machine learning approach with training, validation, and testing phases, and considered features such as part-of-speech, frequencies of insults, punctuation, sentiment, and capitalization. In terms of algorithms, we experimented with Boosted Logistic Regression, Multi-Layer Perceptron, Parallel Random Forest and eXtreme Gradient Boosting.

Previous works have developed datasets to teach conversational agents the appropriate social paradigms to respond effectively to specifically designed hazardous content. However, models trained on these adversarial datasets still struggle to recognize subtle unsafe situations that appear naturally in conversations or introduce an inappropriate response in a casual context.

**Abstract**Large-scale Pre-Trained Language Models (PTLMs) capture knowledge from massive human-written data which contains latent societal biases and toxic contents. In this paper, we leverage the primary task of PTLMs, i.e., language modeling, and propose a new metric to quantify manifested implicit representational harms in PTLMs towards 13 marginalized demographics. Using this metric, we conducted an empirical analysis of 24 widely used PTLMs. Our analysis provides insights into the correlation between the proposed metric in this work and other related metrics for representational harm. We observe that our metric correlates with most of the gender-specific metrics in the literature. Through extensive experiments, we explore the connections between PTLMs architectures and representational harms across two dimensions: depth and width of the networks.

Directly fine-tuning such language models can be effective for tailoring them, but it can be either extremely costly (e.g., GPT-3) or not even feasible for the broader community (e.g., GPT-4).

On five challenging text generation tasks, such as toxicity reduction and lexically constrained generation, IPA consistently brings significant improvements over off-the-shelf language models.

By virtue of the comprehensive annotation of SafeConv, we benchmark three powerful models for the mitigation of conversational unsafe behavior, including a checker to detect unsafe utterances, a tagger to extract unsafe spans, and a rewriter to convert an unsafe response to a safe version. Moreover, we explore the huge benefits brought by combining the models for explaining the emergence of unsafe behavior and detoxifying chatbots.

These fixed prefix templates could themselves be specific in terms of styles or linguistic structures, which may lead to unreliable fairness conclusions that are not representative of the general trends from tone varying prompts. To study this problem, we paraphrase the prompts with different syntactic structures and use these to evaluate demographic bias in NLG systems. Our results suggest similar overall bias trends but some syntactic structures lead to contradictory conclusions compared to past works. We show that our methodology is more robust and that some syntactic structures prompt more toxic content while others could prompt less biased generation.

**Abstract**Transformer-based language models (LMs) are at the core of modern NLP, but their internal prediction construction process is opaque and largely not understood. In this work, we make a substantial step towards unveiling this underlying prediction process, by reverse-engineering the operation of the feed-forward network (FFN) layers, one of the building blocks of transformer models. We view the token representation as a changing distribution over the vocabulary, and the output from each FFN layer as an additive update to that distribution. Then, we analyze the FFN updates in the vocabulary space, showing that each update can be decomposed to sub-updates corresponding to single FFN parameter vectors, each promoting concepts that are often human-interpretable. We then leverage these findings for controlling LM predictions, where we reduce the toxicity of GPT2 by almost 50{\%}, and for improving computation efficiency with a simple early exit rule, saving 20{\%} of computation on average.","Geva, Mor, Caciularu, Avi, Wang, Kevin, Goldberg, Yoav",,,Transformer Feed-Forward Layers Build Predictions by Promoting Concepts in the Vocabulary Space,,,10.18653/v1/2022.emnlp-main.3 , ,,"Transformer-based language models (LMs) are at the core of modern NLP, but their internal prediction construction process is opaque and largely not understood.

**Abstract**Large pretrained language models are successful at generating fluent text but are notoriously hard to controllably sample from.

**Abstract**Most existing dialogue systems fail to respond properly to potentially unsafe user utterances by either ignoring or passively agreeing with them. To address this issue, we introduce ProsocialDialog, the first large-scale multi-turn dialogue dataset to teach conversational agents to respond to problematic content following social norms. Covering diverse unethical, problematic, biased, and toxic situations, ProsocialDialog contains responses that encourage prosocial behavior, grounded in commonsense social rules (i.e., rules-of-thumb, RoTs). Created via a human-AI collaborative framework, ProsocialDialog consists of 58K dialogues, with 331K utterances, 160K unique RoTs, and 497K dialogue safety labels accompanied by free-form rationales.With this dataset, we introduce a dialogue safety detection module, Canary, capable of generating RoTs given conversational context, and a socially-informed dialogue agent, Prost. Empirical results show that Prost generates more socially acceptable dialogues compared to other state-of-the-art language and dialogue models in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings. Additionally, Canary effectively guides conversational agents and off-the-shelf language models to generate significantly more prosocial responses.

**Abstract**Natural language generation (NLG) models can propagate social bias towards particular demography. Though several studies investigated bias from data and model, NLG task distinctively uses stochastic decoder that can positively or negatively impact the bias-sensitive tokens initially predicted by the model. To address this gap in research, we present an extensive analysis of bias from decoding techniques for open-domain language generation considering the entire decoding space. We analyze to what extent bias metrics like toxicity and sentiment are impacted by the individual components of decoder algorithms. To this extent, we also analyze the trade-off between bias scores and human-annotated generation quality throughout the decoder space. Together, these methods reveal the imperative of testing inference time bias and provide evidence on the usefulness of inspecting the entire decoding spectrum.","Das, Mayukh, Balke, Wolf Tilo",,,Quantifying Bias from Decoding Techniques in Natural Language Generation,,, , ,,"Natural language generation (NLG) models can propagate social bias towards particular demography.

**Abstract**This paper contains prompts and model outputs that are offensive in nature. When trained on large, unfiltered crawls from the Internet, language models pick up and reproduce all kinds of undesirable biases that can be found in the data: They often generate racist, sexist, violent, or otherwise toxic language. As large models require millions of training examples to achieve good performance, it is difficult to completely prevent them from being exposed to such content. In this paper, we first demonstrate a surprising finding: Pretrained language models recognize, to a considerable degree, their undesirable biases and the toxicity of the content they produce. We refer to this capability as self-diagnosis. Based on this finding, we then propose a decoding algorithm that, given only a textual description of the undesired behavior, reduces the probability of a language model producing problematic text. We refer to this approach as self-debiasing. Self-debiasing does not rely on manually curated word lists, nor does it require any training data or changes to the model`s parameters.
