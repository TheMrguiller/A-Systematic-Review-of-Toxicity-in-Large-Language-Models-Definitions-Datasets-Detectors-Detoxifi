Hence, toxicity detectors trained on current datasets will also disregard context, making the detection of context-sensitive toxicity a lot harder when it occurs. We constructed and publicly release a dataset of 10k posts with two kinds of toxicity labels per post, obtained from annotators who considered (i) both the current post and the previous one as context, or (ii) only the current post. We introduce a new task, context sensitivity estimation, which aims to identify posts whose perceived toxicity changes if the context (previous post) is also considered. Using the new dataset, we show that systems can be developed for this task. Such systems could be used to enhance toxicity detection datasets with more context-dependent posts, or to suggest when moderators should consider the parent posts, which may not always be necessary and may introduce an additional cost.",,,978-1-954085-59-6,140-145, , 5th Workshop on Structured Prediction for NLP (SPNLP) / 5th Workshop on Online Abuse and Harms (WOAH)5th Workshop on Structured Prediction for NLP (SPNLP) / 5th Workshop on Online Abuse and Harms (WOAH) ,

For predictive toxicology, however, models with a good balance between sensitivity and specificity are needed. In this paper we introduce conformational oversampling as a means to balance and oversample datasets for prediction of toxicity. Conformational oversampling enhances a dataset by generation of multiple conformations of a molecule. These conformations can be used to balance, as well as oversample a dataset, thereby increasing the dataset size without the need of artificial samples. We show that conformational oversampling facilitates training of neural networks and provides state-of-the-art results on the Tox21 dataset.",1758-2946,,,, ,  ,

Most recent work on toxic speech detection is constrained to the modality of text and written conversations with very limited work on toxicity detection from spoken utterances or using the modality of speech. In this paper, we introduce a new dataset DeToxy, the first publicly available toxicity annotated dataset for the English language. DeToxy is sourced from various openly available speech databases and consists of over 2 million utterances. We believe that our dataset would act as a benchmark for the relatively new and unexplored Spoken Language Processing (SLP) task of detecting toxicity from spoken utterances and boost further research in this space. Finally, we also provide strong unimodal baselines for our dataset and compare traditional two-step cascade and End-to-End (E2E) approaches. Our experiments show that in the case of spoken utterances, text-based approaches are largely dependent on gold human-annotated transcripts for their performance and also suffer from the problem of keyword bias. However, the presence of speech files in DeToxy helps facilitates the development of E2E speech models which alleviate both the above-stated problems by better capturing speech clues.",2308-457X,,*****************,5185-5189, , Interspeech ConferenceInterspeech Conference ,

Moderators try to limit this problem by implementing more and more refined comment filters, but toxic users are constantly finding new ways to circumvent them. Our hypothesis is that while modifying toxic content and keywords to fool filters can be easy, hiding sentiment is harder. In this paper, we explore various aspects of sentiment detection and their correlation to toxicity, and use our results to implement a toxicity detection tool. We then test how adding the sentiment information helps detect toxicity in three different real-world datasets, and incorporate subversion to these datasets to simulate a user trying to circumvent the system.

An Empirical Analysis of Hate Speech Datasets",,, ,Proceedings Paper ,2020,"The field of the automatic detection of hate speech and related concepts has raised a lot of interest in the last years. Different datasets were annotated and classified by means of applying different machine learning algorithms. However, few efforts were done in order to clarify the applied categories and homogenize different datasets. Our study takes up this demand. We analyze six different publicly available datasets in this field with respect to their similarity and compatibility. We conduct two different experiments. First, we try to make the datasets compatible and represent the dataset classes as Fast Text word vectors analyzing the similarity between different classes in a intra and inter dataset manner. Second, we submit the chosen datasets to the Perspective API Toxicity classifier, achieving different performances depending on the categories and datasets. One of the main conclusions of these experiments is that many different definitions are being used for equivalent concepts, which makes most of the publicly available datasets incompatible.

However, toxicity data are often class-imbalanced, which hinders the development of machine learning models with good performance. Therefore, in this study, we identified effective data-balancing methods for class-imbalanced genotoxicity datasets using machine learning algorithms and molecular fingerprints. Data-balancing methods, such as random undersampling (RUS), sample weight (SW), synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE), and random oversampling (ROS) were applied to the datasets. Model performance was evaluated using the F1 score on five machine learning algorithms: gradient boosting tree (GBT), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network, and k-nearest neighbors (kNN) in combination with five molecular fingerprints (Morgan, MACCS, RDKit, Pattern, and Layered). The performance was evaluated for each combination of molecular fingerprints, machine learning algorithms, and data-balancing methods. The MACCS-GBT-SMOTE combination model achieved the best F1 score, followed by RDKit-GBT-SW. Thus, this study demonstrated that data balancing conducted using oversampling methods improved the performance of models. The systematic approach used in this study can also be applied to other toxicity datasets, which may facilitate the development of an improved classification model for toxicity screening.",2468-1113,,,, ,  ,

For example, victims of toxic conversations may become afraid to express themselves, therefore get demotivated, and may eventually leave the project. Automated filtering of toxic conversations may help a FOSS community maintain healthy interactions among its members. However, off-the-shelf toxicity detectors perform poorly on a software engineering dataset, such as one curated from code review comments. To counter this challenge, we present ToxiCR, a supervised learning based toxicity identification tool for code review interactions. ToxiCR includes a choice to select one of the 10 supervised learning algorithms, an option to select text vectorization techniques, eight preprocessing steps, and a large-scale labeled dataset of 19,651 code review comments. Two out of those eight preprocessing steps are software engineering domain specific. With our rigorous evaluation of the models with various combinations of preprocessing steps and vectorization techniques, we have identified the best combination for our dataset that boosts 95.8% accuracy and an 88.9% F1-score in identifying toxic texts.

Although, several general purpose tools exist to identify toxic contents, those may incorrectly flag some words commonly used in the Software Engineering (SE) context as toxic (e.g., 'junk', 'kill', and 'dump') and vice versa. To encounter this challenge, an SE specific tool has been proposed by the CMU Strudel Lab (referred as the 'STRUDEL' hereinafter) by combining the output of the Perspective API with the output from a customized version of the Stanford's Politeness detector tool. However, since STRUDEL's evaluation was very limited with only 654 SE text, its practical applicability is unclear. Therefore, this study aims to empirically evaluate the Strudel tool as well as four state-of-the-art general purpose toxicity detectors on a large scale SE dataset. On this goal, we empirically developed a rubric to manually label toxic SE interactions. Using this rubric, we manually labeled a dataset of 6,533 code review comments and 4,140 Gitter messages. The results of our analyses suggest significant degradation of all tools' performances on our datasets. Those degradations were significantly higher on our dataset of formal SE communication such as code review than on our dataset of informal communication such as Gitter messages. Two of the models from our study showed significant performance improvements during 10-fold cross validations after we retrained those on our SE datasets.

We propose an XRBi-GAC framework comprising XLM-RoBERTa, Bi-GRU with self-attention and capsule networks for multilingual toxic text detection. A loss function is also presented, which fuses the binary cross-entropy loss and focal loss to address the class imbalance problem. We evaluated the proposed framework on two datasets, namely, the Jigsaw Multilingual Toxic Comment dataset and HASOC 2019 dataset and achieved F1-score of 0.865 and 0.829, respectively.

The demanding experimental assessment of toxicity, compared with NP innovation and time to market, has led to the extensive development of in silico methods, such as SAR models, aiming at providing a more rapid toxicity screening of such NPs. However, such models are usually built upon a limited number of data, making the different approaches case-sensitive. Furthermore, the focus on the predictive capabilities of the models, deem the extraction of scientific knowledge secondary, hindering the mechanistic understanding of toxicity mechanisms. In this paper, we instead shift the focus by using the models as a first step towards induction and extraction of valuable mechanistic information, once the predictive ability of the model has been validated. For this reason, we use a large dataset consisting of 935 toxicity measurements for 45 metal and metal oxide NPs, to build classification nano-SAR models. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the largest dataset of individual toxicity measurements for such NPs. Although the dataset is heterogeneous, the models developed are able to accurately classify the NPs based on their toxicity towards a variety of cells and organisms, using the same descriptors. Based on the quality of the results, the potential mechanisms of toxicity are identified and discussed in depth, providing a more holistic approach towards metal and metal oxide NP toxicity. The presented approach aims to trigger a discussion regarding information that could be derived from nano-SAR models, that could pave the way towards a more knowledge-based risk assessment of NPs and guide researchers towards the synthesis of safe-by-design NPs.",2051-8153,2051-8161,,761-780, ,  ,

Although several 'toxicity' detection datasets and models have been published, most of them ignore the context of the posts, implicitly assuming that comments may be judged independently. We investigate this assumption by focusing on two questions: (a) does context affect the human judgement, and (b) does conditioning on context improve performance of toxicity detection systems? We experiment with Wikipedia conversations, limiting the notion of context to the previous post in the thread and the discussion title. We find that context can both amplify or mitigate the perceived toxicity of posts. Moreover, a small but significant subset of manually labeled posts (5% in one of our experiments) end up having the opposite toxicity labels if the annotators are not provided with context. Surprisingly, we also find no evidence that context actually improves the performance of toxicity classifiers, having tried a range of classifiers and mechanisms to make them context aware. This points to the need for larger datasets of comments annotated in context.

We then propose to bring these findings into computational detection models by introducing and evaluating (a) neural architectures for contextual toxicity detection that are aware of the conversational structure, and (b) data augmentation strategies that can help model contextual toxicity detection.

In this scenario, the detection of this kind of toxicity has an important role to moderate online communication. Deep learning technologies have recently delivered impressive performance within Natural Language Processing applications encompassing Sentiment Analysis and emotion detection across numerous datasets. Such models do not need any pre-defined hand-picked features, but they learn sophisticated features from the input datasets by themselves. In such a domain, word embeddings have been widely used as a way of representing words in Sentiment Analysis tasks, proving to be very effective.

We disentangle what is annotated as toxic by considering posts with three characteristics: anti-Black language, African American English (AAE) dialect, and vulgarity. Our results show strong associations between annotator identity and beliefs and their ratings of toxicity. Notably, more conservative annotators and those who scored highly on our scale for racist beliefs were less likely to rate anti-Black language as toxic, but more likely to rate AAE as toxic.

Experiments demonstrate that jointly training the pretrained language model with a multitask objective can effectively mitigate the impacts of unintended biases and is more robust to model bias towards commonly-attacked identity groups presented in datasets without significantly hurting the model's generalizability.",2158-3404,,978-1-6654-3580-2,, , IEEE International Symposium on Technology and Society (ISTAS) - Technological Stewardship and Responsible InnovationIEEE International Symposium on Technology and Society (ISTAS) - Technological Stewardship and Responsible Innovation ,

General Machine learning literature provides evidence in favor of some classifier families (random forest, support vector machine, gradient boosting) in terms of classification performance. The purpose of this study is to compare such classifiers specifically for (chemo)radiotherapy datasets and to estimate their average discriminative performance for radiation treatment outcome prediction.MethodsWe collected 12 datasets (3496 patients) from prior studies on post-(chemo)radiotherapy toxicity, survival, or tumor control with clinical, dosimetric, or blood biomarker features from multiple institutions and for different tumor sites, that is, (non-)small-cell lung cancer, head and neck cancer, and meningioma. Six common classification algorithms with built-in feature selection (decision tree, random forest, neural network, support vector machine, elastic net logistic regression, LogitBoost) were applied on each dataset using the popular open-source R package caret. The R code and documentation for the analysis are available online (). All classifiers were run on each dataset in a 100-repeated nested fivefold cross-validation with hyperparameter tuning. Performance metrics (AUC, calibration slope and intercept, accuracy, Cohen's kappa, and Brier score) were computed. We ranked classifiers by AUC to determine which classifier is likely to also perform well in future studies. We simulated the benefit for potential investigators to select a certain classifier for a new dataset based on our study (pre-selection based on other datasets) or estimating the best classifier for a dataset (set-specific selection based on information from the new dataset) compared with uninformed classifier selection (random selection).ResultsRandom forest (best in 6/12 datasets) and elastic net logistic regression (best in 4/12 datasets) showed the overall best discrimination, but there was no single best classifier across datasets. Both classifiers had a median AUC rank of 2. Preselection and set-specific selection yielded a significant average AUC improvement of 0.02 and 0.02 over random selection with an average AUC rank improvement of 0.42 and 0.66, respectively.ConclusionRandom forest and elastic net logistic regression yield higher discriminative performance in (chemo)radiotherapy outcome and toxicity prediction than other studied classifiers. Thus, one of these two classifiers should be the first choice for investigators when building classification models or to benchmark one's own modeling results against. Our results also show that an informed preselection of classifiers based on existing datasets can improve discrimination over random selection.",0094-2405,2473-4209,,3449-3459, ,  ,

A particular emphasis is on the toxicity levels of discussions on various issues. Three platforms have been chosen for a comparative study: the first is a Reddit-like online forum, the second is Polis, where participants may vote on issues and is touted as a forum for computational democracy, and the third is called the Deliberatorium, developed at the Center for Collective Intelligence at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. These platforms have their own specific structures that aid in group discussions on various issues. An important question that has been examined in this paper is how to characterize the contagion of toxicity in the three platforms and the extent to which their structures inhibit it. Our approach has been to first extract two sets of actual data from the three platforms: a control group and an experimental group where in the latter, an intervention is used by inserting an empathy statement to inhibit toxicity. Toxicity levels (determined using Google Perspective API) were compared using sample data from the three platforms. We use generative models that extend the sample datasets by adding synthetic nodes (artificial entries in group discussions) from the three platforms based on parameter values of popularity, novelty, root-bias, and reciprocity among participants. Two additional parameters of node type and toxicity score were added to these synthetic nodes. The generative models help in extending existing datasets to determine the contagion of toxicity in the platform. This is achieved by developing an index for toxicity contagion, ECtox expressed as a percentage of the total number of nodes. The idea of developing this index has been adapted from work in ecological studies where contagion of a certain type of land patch is examined in the presence of several different patch types. We use this metric to assess toxicity contagion in both the control and experimental groups of the three platforms. With the intervention of the empathy statement, Deliberatorium had an improvement in ECtox from 1.309% to 1.297%. In Forum, however, ECtox actually increased from 1.711% to 1.951%. Finally, in Polis, there was an improvement in ECtox from 1.750% to 1.663%. Thus, for Deliberatorium, the flow of toxicity is the least. We infer that there are inherent structural constructs in the design of the Deliberatorium, and that may naturally inhibit toxicity in group discussions.",,,978-1-6654-7300-2,109-116, , IEEE 8th International Conference on Collaboration and Internet Computing (CIC)IEEE 8th International Conference on Collaboration and Internet Computing (CIC) ,

We propose a Process for Adapting Language Models to Society (PALMS) with ValuesTargeted Datasets, an iterative process to significantly change model behavior by crafting and fine-tuning on a dataset that reflects a predetermined set of target values. We evaluate our process using three metrics: quantitative metrics with human evaluations that score output adherence to a target value, toxicity scoring on outputs; and qualitative metrics analyzing the most common word associated with a given social category. Through each iteration, we add additional training dataset examples based on observed shortcomings from evaluations. PALMS performs significantly better on all metrics compared to baseline and control models for a broad range of GPT-3 language model sizes without compromising capability integrity. We find that the effectiveness of PALMS increases with model size.

Considering that current debiasing methods for general natural language understanding tasks cannot effectively mitigate the biases in the toxicity detectors, we propose to use invariant rationalization (INVRAT), a game-theoretic framework consisting of a rationale generator and predictors, to rule out the spurious correlation of certain syntactic patterns (e.g., identity mentions, dialect) to toxicity labels.

We model the data before prediction points using the multiple instance learning, where each bag is composed of multiple instances associated with daily treatments and patient-specific attributes, such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, age and cancer types. We then formulate a Bayesian multi-task framework to enhance toxicity prediction at each prediction point. The use of the prior allows factors to be shared across task predictors.

For example, texts containing some demographic identity-terms (e.g., gay, black) are more likely to be abusive in existing abusive language detection datasets. As a result, models trained with these datasets may consider sentences like She makes me happy to be gay as abusive simply because of the word gay. In this paper, we formalize the unintended biases in text classification datasets as a kind of selection bias from the non-discrimination distribution to the discrimination distribution. Based on this formalization, we further propose a model-agnostic debiasing training framework by recovering the non-discrimination distribution using instance weighting, which does not require any extra resources or annotations apart from a pre-defined set of demographic identity-terms. Experiments demonstrate that our method can effectively alleviate the impacts of the unintended biases without significantly hurting models' generalization ability.",,,978-1-952148-25-5,4134-4145, , 58th Annual Meeting of the Association-for-Computational-Linguistics (ACL)58th Annual Meeting of the Association-for-Computational-Linguistics (ACL) ,

We develop a demonstration-based prompting framework and an adversarial classifier-in-the-loop decoding method to generate subtly toxic and benign text with a massive pretrained language model (Brown et al., 2020). Controlling machine generation in this way allows TOXIGEN to cover implicitly toxic text at a larger scale, and about more demographic groups, than previous resources of human-written text. We conduct a human evaluation on a challenging subset of TOXIGEN and find that annotators struggle to distinguish machine-generated text from human-written language. We also find that 94.5% of toxic examples are labeled as hate speech by human annotators. Using three publicly-available datasets, we show that finetuning a toxicity classifier on our data improves its performance on human-written data substantially.

Nevertheless, the huge number of ILs makes the toxicity data collection expensive and time-consuming, which motivates modeling development to fill data gaps of ILs toxicity. The group contribution (GC) method has been extensively applied for the estimation of various properties of ionic liquids. This study proposed a novel method, named the non-integer group contribution (NGC) method, which creatively utilizes the atomic electrostatic potential descriptors for modeling. Specifically, the average values of electrostatic potential (AV(EP)) and the electrostatic potential surface area (SEP) of atoms in the cations and anions of ILs were calculated and used to obtain the group descriptors in this work. Two NGC models were developed to predict the toxicity of ILs. Results show that both proposed models have satisfactory predictability. In contrast, the NGC-2 model based on SEP descriptors exhibits better predictability due to its higher coefficient of determination (R-2 = 0.927), the lower average absolute relative deviation (AARD = 11.257 %) and root mean square error (RMSE = 0.261) for the entire dataset. The NGC-2 model also shows better performance than the traditional GC method, demonstrating its advanced superiority. Therefore, the proposed approach has high potential in terms of generalization and applicability for predicting the property of compounds. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

To answer (i), we experiment with BERT, ALBERT, fastText, and SVM models trained on nine common public English datasets, whose class (or category) labels are standardized (and thus made comparable), in intra-and cross-dataset setups. The experiments show that indeed the generalization varies from model to model and that some of the categories (e.g., ?toxic?, ?abusive?, or ?offensive?) serve better as cross-dataset training categories than others (e.g., ?hate speech?). To answer (ii), we use a Random Forest model for assessing the relevance of different model and dataset features during the prediction of the performance of 450 BERT, 450 ALBERT, 450 fastText, and 348 SVM binary abusive language classifiers (1698 in total).

Increasing prevalence of cancer, particularly in developing countries, demands better understandings of the effectiveness and adverse consequences of different cancer treatment regimes in real patient populations. Current understandings of cancer treatment toxicities are often derived from either clean patient cohorts or coarse population statistics. Thus, it is difficult to get up-to-date and local assessments of treatment toxicities for specific cancer centers. To address these problems, we propose a novel and efficient method for discovering toxicity progression patterns in the form of temporal association rules (TARs). A temporal association rule is defined as a rule where the diagnosis codes in the right hand side (e.g., a combination of toxicities/complications) are temporally occurred after the diagnosis codes in the left hand side (e.g., a particular type of cancer treatment). Our method develops a lattice structure to efficiently discover TARs. More specifically, the lattice structure is first constructed to store all frequent diagnosis codes in the dataset. It is then traversed using the paternity relations among nodes to generate TARs. Our extensive experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed method in discovering major toxicity patterns in comparison with the temporal comorbidity analysis. In addition, our method significantly outperforms existing methods for mining TARs in terms of runtime. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",0950-7051,1872-7409,,313-328, ,  ,

The closure data were simulated for each scallop (Pecten maximus) fishing area through an algorithm applied to the in situ dataset from the French monitoring network REPHYTOX. The methodology of the production of closure data consists of comparing phycotoxin concentration in scallop to regulatory thresholds of phycotoxins, and then, simulating the number and duration of closures based on the monitoring strategies and closure mechanisms as defined in the regulations. These data only cover closures related to regulatory threshold exceedances of phycotoxins in shellfish. Closures induced by the lack of sampling or other reasons (e.g., failures in toxin analysis) are not included in the dataset because of the lack of information. Data are produced during the scallop fishing season. Facing the non-existence of such a closure database due to the lack of centralized management of local closure decrees, this dataset can be used to analyse the management strategies to deal with HABs and to highlight the governance challenges related to these strategies.

Hence, there is an urgent need to provide coherent (eco)toxicological datasets containing comprehensive toxicity information relating to a diverse spectra of NPs characters. These datasets are test benches for developing holistic methodologies with broader applicability. In the present study we assessed the effects of a custom design Fe-doped TiO2 NPs library, using the soil invertebrate Enchytraeus crypticus (Oligochaeta), via a 5-day pulse via aqueous exposure followed by a 21-days recovery period in soil (survival, reproduction assessment). Obviously, when testing TiO2, realistic conditions should include UV exposure. The 11 Fe-TiO2 library contains NPs of size range between 5-27 nm with varying %Fe (enabling the photoactivation of TiO2 at energy wavelengths in the visible-light range). The NPs were each described by 122 descriptors, being a mixture of measured and atomistic model descriptors. The data were explored using single and univariate statistical methods, combined with machine learning and multiscale modelling techniques. An iterative pruning process was adopted for identifying automatically the most significant descriptors. TiO2 NPs toxicity decreased when combined with UV.

Methods: we proposed a deep convolutional autoencoder (DCAE) approach for automatic MA removal in EDA signals. Our model was trained using several publicly available datasets that were collected using a wide variety of stimuli to cause EDA reactions; the sample size was large (N = 385 subjects). We trained and validated our DCAE network using both Gaussian white noise (GWN) and realistic MA data records collected using a novel circuitry in our lab. We further evaluated and compared the performance of our DCAE model with the existing methods on two independent and unseen datasets called Chon lab motion artifact dataset II (CMAD II) and central nervous system oxygen toxicity dataset (CNS-OT). Results: Our DCAE model showed significantly higher signal-to-noise-power-ratio improvement (SNRimp) and lower mean squared error (MSE) when compared with that of the three previous methods (averaged SNRimp=35.25dB, and MSE =0.028 on the MA-corrupted data). Moreover, the reconstructed EDAs from the CMAD II dataset had a mean correlation value of 0.78 (statistically significantly higher when compared with other methods) with the reference clean data from the motionless hand, whereas the raw MA-corrupted data had a correlation value of only 0.68. Conclusion: The results presented in the paper indicates that our DCAE can remove MAs with higher intensity where the existing methods fails. Significance: Proposed DCAE model can be used to recover a significant amount of otherwise discarded EDA data.",0018-9294,1558-2531,,3601-3611, ,  ,

These include the consensus approach to generate the final prediction of a model, utilizing new, advanced machine learning algorithms and streamlining, standardization and automation of various QSAR steps. One approach that seems under-explored is at-the-runtime generation of local models specific to individual compounds. This approach was quite likely limited by the computational requirements, but with current increases in processing power and the widespread availability of cluster-computing infrastructure, this limitation is no longer that severe.ResultsWe propose a new QSAR methodology: aiQSAR, whose aim is to generate endpoint predictions directly from the input dataset by building an array of local models generated at-the-runtime and specific for each compound in the dataset. The local group of each compound is selected on the basis of fingerprint similarities and the final prediction is calculated by integrating the results of a number of autonomous mathematical models. The method is applicable to regression, binary classification and multi-class classification and was tested on one dataset for each endpoint type: bioconcentration factor (BCF) for regression, Ames test for binary classification and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) acute rat oral toxicity ranking for multi-class classification. As part of this method, the applicability domain of each prediction is assessed through the applicability domain measure, calculated on the basis of the fingerprint similarities in each local group of compounds.ConclusionsWe outline the methodology for a new QSAR-based predictive tool whose advantages are automation, group-specific approach to modelling and simplicity of execution. Our aim now will be to develop this method into a stand-alone software tool. We hope that eventual adoption of our tool would make QSAR modelling more accessible and transparent. Our methodology could be used as an initial modelling step, to predict new compounds by simply loading the training dataset as an input. Predictions could then be further evaluated and refined either by other tools or through optimization of aiQSAR parameters.",1758-2946,,,, ,  ,

The models were created using text data, which we extracted from social networks in the Slovak language. The labelling of our dataset of short texts into multiple classes-the degrees of toxicity-was provided automatically by our method based on the lexicon approach to texts processing. This lexicon method required creating a dictionary of toxic words in the Slovak language, which is another contribution of the work.

To improve efficiency of the proposed method, both the cut information and attribute information are adopted to dynamically calculate heuristic information, and a local search strategy is also embedded.

The results suggest that physical characteristics of microplastics are important toxicity determinants in soil ecosystems. Given the potential for adverse environmental effects, further effective management strategies should urgently be employed in these areas. This study provided an integrated perspective of microplastic ecotoxicity in soil. In addition, SSDs were estimated using larger datasets and for more species than in previous studies. This is the first study to consider microplastic properties for estimating SSD.",0304-3894,1873-3336,,, ,  ,

Our focus is on lexical (e.g., swear words, slurs, identity mentions) and dialectal markers (specifically African American English). Our comprehensive experiments establish that existing methods are limited in their ability to prevent biased behavior in current toxicity detectors. We then propose an automatic, dialect-aware data correction method, as a proof-of-concept study. Despite the use of synthetic labels, this method reduces dialectal associations with toxicity.

However, there are serious concerns regarding the harmful effects that NPs can cause to the different biological systems and their ecosystems. Toxicity testing is an essential step for assessing the potential risks of the NPs, but the experimental assays are often very expensive and usually too slow to flag the number of NPs that may cause adverse effects. In silico models centered on quantitative structure-activity/toxicity relationships (QSAR/QSTR) are alternative tools that have become valuable supports to risk assessment, rationalizing the search for safer NPs. In this work, we develop a unified QSTR-perturbation model based on artificial neural networks, aimed at simultaneously predicting general toxicity profiles of NPs under diverse experimental conditions. The model is derived from 54,371NP-NP pair cases generated by applying the perturbation theory to a set of 260 unique NPs, and showed an accuracy higher than 97% in both training and validation sets. Physicochemical interpretation of the different descriptors in the model are additionally provided. The QSTR-perturbation model is then employed to predict the toxic effects of several NPs not included in the original dataset.

To achieve this, multiple datasets were collected from different online social networking platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. The latest samples were obtained by collecting data based on the topmost keywords extracted from the existing datasets. The instances were then labeled as toxic/nontoxic using toxicity analysis, and traditional machine-learning (ML) techniques such as linear support vector machine (SVM), conventional random forest (RF), and transformer-based ML techniques such as bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) were employed to design a toxic-fake news detection (FND) and classification system.

In recent years, one popular method for automatic segmentation of nuclei has been deep learning enhanced marker-controlled watershed transform. In this method, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been used to create nuclei masks and markers, and the watershed algorithm for the instance segmentation. We studied whether this method could be improved for the segmentation of densely cultivated 3D nuclei via developing multiple system configurations in which we studied the effect of edge emphasizing CNNs, and optimized H-minima transform for mask and marker generation, respectively. Results The dataset used for training and evaluation consisted of twelve in vitro cultivated densely packed 3D human carcinoma cell spheroids imaged using a confocal microscope. With this dataset, the evaluation was performed using a cross-validation scheme. In addition, four independent datasets were used for evaluation. The datasets were resampled near isotropic for our experiments. The baseline deep learning enhanced marker-controlled watershed obtained an average of 0.69 Panoptic Quality (PQ) and 0.66 Aggregated Jaccard Index (AJI) over the twelve spheroids.

Our tool enables the investigation of individual patients and cohorts through the entire treatment process, and it can give indications of RT-induced complications for the patient. In prostate cancer RT treatment, despite the design of an initial plan prior to dose administration, bladder toxicity remains very common. The main reason is that the dose is delivered in multiple fractions over a period of weeks, during which, the anatomical variation of the bladder - due to differences in urinary filling - causes deviations between planned and delivered doses. Clinical researchers want to correlate bladder shape variations to dose deviations and toxicity risk through cohort studies, to understand which specific bladder shape characteristics are more prone to side effects. This is currently done with Dose-Volume Histograms (DVHs), which provide limited, qualitative insight. The effect of bladder variation on dose delivery and the resulting toxicity cannot be currently examined with the DVHs. To address this need, we designed and implemented the Bladder Runner, which incorporates visualization strategies in a highly interactive environment with multiple linked views. Individual patients can be explored and analyzed through the entire treatment period, while inter-patient and temporal exploration, analysis and comparison are also supported. We demonstrate the applicability of our presented tool with a usage scenario, employing a dataset of 29 patients followed through the course of the treatment, across 13 time points.

Leveraging a dataset of 382 molecules with toxicity labels from honey bee exposure experiments, we train a support vector machine (SVM) to predict the toxicity of pesticides to honey bees. We compare two representations of the pesticide molecules: (i) a random walk feature vector listing counts of length-L walks on the molecular graph with each vertex- and edge-label sequence and (ii) the Molecular ACCess System (MACCS) structural key fingerprint (FP), a bit vector indicating the presence/absence of a list of pre-defined subgraph patterns in the molecular graph.

In this paper, we show that it is possible to construct weight poisoning attacks where pre-trained weights are injected with vulnerabilities that expose backdoors afterfine-tuning, enabling the attacker to manipulate the model prediction simply by injecting an arbitrary keyword. We show that by applying a regularization method, which we call RIPPLe, and an initialization procedure, which we call Embedding Surgery, such attacks are possible even with limited knowledge of the dataset and fine-tuning procedure. Our experiments on sentiment classification, toxicity detection, arid wain detection show that this attack is widely applicable and poses a serious threat. Finally, we outline practical defenses against such attacks.

Machine learning models have been developed to detect toxic comments online, yet these models tend to show biases against users with marginalized or minority identities (e.g., females and African Americans). Established research in debiasing toxicity classifiers often (1) takes a static or batch approach, assuming that all information is available and then making a one-time decision; and (2) uses a generic strategy to mitigate different biases (e.g., gender and racial biases) that assumes the biases are independent of one another. However, in real scenarios, the input typically arrives as a sequence of comments/words over time instead of all at once. Thus, decisions based on partial information must be made while additional input is arriving. Moreover, social bias is complex by nature. Each type of bias is defined within its unique context, which, consistent with intersectionality theory within the social sciences, might be correlated with the contexts of other forms of bias. In this work, we consider debiasing toxicity detection as a sequential decision-making process where different biases can be interdependent. In particular, we study debiasing toxicity detection with two aims: (1) to examine whether different biases tend to correlate with each other; and (2) to investigate how to jointly mitigate these correlated biases in an interactive manner to minimize the total amount of bias. At the core of our approach is a framework built upon theories of sequential Markov Decision Processes that seeks to maximize the prediction accuracy and minimize the bias measures tailored to individual biases. Evaluations on two benchmark datasets empirically validate the hypothesis that biases tend to be correlated and corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed sequential debiasing strategy.",,,978-1-4503-8732-3,1750-1760, , 45th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval (SIGIR)45th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval (SIGIR) ,

The kernel not only captures the semantic and syntactic relational information contained in the data but also provides the flexibility of using arbitrary forms of structured and non-structured data coded in a relational way. While specialised kernels have been developed for strings, trees and graphs our approach uses declarative background knowledge to provide the learning bias. The use of explicitly encoded background knowledge distinguishes SVILP from existing relational kernels which in ILP-terms work purely at the atomic generalisation level. The SVILP approach is a form of generalisation relative to background knowledge, though the final combining function for the ILP-learned clauses is an SVM rather than a logical conjunction. We evaluate SVILP empirically against related approaches, including an industry-standard toxin predictor called TOPKAT. Evaluation is conducted on a new broad-ranging toxicity dataset (DSSTox).

Patients had three CT scans acquired throughout the duration of the radiation treatment course. Pretreatment planning CT scans with a median of 13 days before treatment (range: 2-27), mid-treatment CT at 22 days after start of treatment (range: 13-38), and post-treatment CT 65 days after start of treatment (range: 35-192). Patients received RT treatment to a total dose of 58-70 Gy, using daily 2.0-2.20 Gy, fractions for 30-35 fractions. The fan-beam CT images were acquired using a Siemens 16-slice CT scanner head protocol with 120 kV and current of 400 mAs.

As part of this, two new measures for dataset dispersion, called mean neighborhood target standard deviation (MNTSD), and mean neighborhood target entropy (MNTE) are formulated to determine the expeced performance while using KNN regressors and classifiers, respectively. It is empirically demonstrated that these measures of dispersion can be indicative of the performance of KNN regression and classification. This idea is further used to learn feature weights that help improve the accuracy of KNN classification and regression. For this, it is argued that the MNTSD and MNTE, when used to learn feature weights, cannot be optimized using gradient-based optimization methods and we develop optimization strategies based on metaheuristic methods, namely genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimization.

Information on PBT position relative to the high-dose could aid risk management. We investigated template matching + triangulation for high-frequency markerless 3D PBT position monitoring.Materials and methods: Kilovoltage projections of a moving phantom (full-fan cone-beam CT [CBCT, 15 frames/second] without MV irradiation: 889 images/dataset + CBCT and 7 frames/second fluoroscopy with MV irradiation) and ten patients undergoing free-breathing stereotactic/hypofractionated lung irradiation (full-fan CBCT without MV irradiation, 470-500 images/dataset) were retrospectively analyzed. 2D PBT reference templates (1 filtered digitally reconstructed radiograph/degrees) were created from planning CT data. Using normalized cross-correlation, templates were matched to projection images for 2D position. Multiple registrations were triangulated for 3D position.Results: For the phantom, 2D right/left PBT position could be determined in 86.6/75.1% of the CBCT dataset without MV irradiation, and 3D position (excluding first 20 degrees due to the minimum triangulation angle) in 84.7/72.7%. With MV irradiation, this was up to 2% less. For right/left PBT, root-mean-square errors of measured versus known position were 0.5/0.8, 0.4-0.5/0.7, and 0.4/0.5-0.6 mm for left-right, superior-inferior, and anterior-posterior directions, respectively. 2D PBT position was determined in, on average, 89.8% of each patient dataset (range: 79.4-99.2%), and 3D position (excluding first 20 degrees) in 85.1% (range: 67.9-99.6%).

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of RR on intrafraction motion of the prostate. Intrafraction motion of the prostate with RR and without it was recorded with electromagnetic real-time tracking system. Intrafractional motion data of 260 RR fractions and 351 non-RR fractions from 22 patients was analyzed. 3D and unidirectional motion patterns between RR and non-RR fraction datasets were compared in terms of percentage time at displacement. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6mmover 6 and 10 min of tracking time. Temporal patterns of the prostate motion were evaluated by re-binning the motion data in 1 min time intervals. The percentage time at displacement was larger in RR data compared to non-RR data in every direction (except anterior) and for every motion magnitude considered. For non-RR fractions the percentage of time of. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6mm3Ddisplacements within 10 min of tracking time were 44.8%, 16.0%, 6.4%, 2.9%, 1.4% and 0.5%, respectively. For RR fractions the corresponding percentages were 69.6%, 32.8%, 15.3%, 7.4%, 3.7% and 2.2%, respectively. The difference in 3D motion between the datasets was statistically significant (p < 0.03). Largest increase in the motion was seen in inferior and posterior directions when the RR was used. Motion increased linearly as a function of elapsed tracking time in both RR and non-RR datasets but the increase was more rapid in RR fractions. The use of RR increases the intrafraction motion of the prostate which can lead to inaccurate treatment localization and delivery thus questioning the justification of its use.",2057-1976,,,, ,  ,

With most of these automation networks, inter-observer variation is an acknowledged problem that leads to suboptimal results. This problem is even more significant in segmenting postoperative clinical target volumes (CTV) because they lack a macroscopic visible tumor in the image. This study, using postoperative prostate CTV segmentation as the test case, tries to determine 1) whether physician styles are consistent and learnable, 2) whether physician style affects treatment outcome and toxicity, and 3) how to explicitly deal with different physician styles in DL-assisted CTV segmentation to facilitate its clinical acceptance. Methods: A dataset of 373 postoperative prostate cancer patients from UT Southwestern Medical Center was used for this study. We used another 83 patients from Mayo Clinic to validate the developed model and its adaptability. To determine whether physician styles are consistent and learnable, we trained a 3D convolutional neural network classifier to identify which physician had contoured a CTV from just the contour and the corresponding CT scan. Next, we evaluated whether adapting automatic segmentation to specific physician styles would be clinically feasible based on a lack of difference between outcomes. Here, biochemical progression-free survival (BCFS) and grade 3+ genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method and compared between physician styles with the log rank test and subsequently with a multivariate Cox regression. When we found no statistically significant differences in outcome or toxicity between contouring styles, we proposed a concept called physician style-aware (PSA) segmentation by developing an encodermultidecoder network with perceptual loss to model different physician styles of CTV segmentation. Results: The classification network captured the different physician styles with 87% accuracy. Subsequent outcome analysis showed no differences in BCFS and grade 3+ toxicity among physicians. With the proposed physician style-aware network (PSA-Net), Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) accuracy for all physicians was 3.4% higher on average than with a general model that does not differentiate physician styles. We show that these stylistic contouring variations also exist between institutions that follow the same segmentation guidelines, and we show the proposed method's effectiveness in adapting to new institutional styles. We observed an accuracy improvement of 5% in terms of DSC when adapting to the style of a separate institution. Conclusion: The performance of the classification network established that physician styles are learnable, and the lack of difference between outcomes among physicians shows that the network can feasibly adapt to different styles in the clinic. Therefore, we developed a novel PSA-Net model that can produce contours specific to the treating physician, thus improving segmentation accuracy and avoiding the need to train multiple models to achieve different style segmentations. We successfully validated this model on data from a separate institution, thus supporting the model's generalizability to diverse datasets.",0933-3657,1873-2860,,, ,  ,

This can be used to drive the development of future models, with the sensitive attribute acting as a connecting element to these metrics. Hence, this study aims to analyze patterns in several metrics for identifying bias and fairness, applying the gender-sensitive attribute as a case study, for three different areas of applications in machine learning models: computer vision, natural language processing, and recommendation systems. The gender attribute case study has been used in computer vision, natural language processing, and recommendation systems. The method entailed creating use cases for facial recognition in the FairFace dataset, message toxicity in the Jigsaw dataset, and movie recommendations in the MovieLens100K dataset, then developing models based on the VGG19, BERT, and Wide Deep architectures and evaluating them using the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score classification metrics, as well as assessing their outcomes using fourteen fairness metrics. Certain metrics disclosed bias and fairness, while others did not, revealing a consistent pattern for the same sensitive attribute across different application domains, and similarities for the statistical parity, PPR disparity, and error disparity metrics across domains, indicating fairness related to the studied sensitive attribute. Some attributes, on the other hand, did not follow this pattern.

We aim to determine if these tools flag these messages under any of their classifications of hateful speech (e.g. hate speech, offensive language, toxicity etc.). Close analysis of the classifications and errors shows that current hate speech detection tools are ineffective in detecting misogynoir. They lack sensitivity to context, which is an essential component for misogynoir detection. We found that tweets likely to be classified as hate speech explicitly reference racism or sexism or use profane or aggressive words.

This paper describes a simple process for estimating child health impact at a parcel level by cleaning and synthesizing municipal datasets that are commonly available but seldom joined due to data quality issues. Using geocoding as the core record linkage mechanism, parcel-level toxicity data can be combined with school enrollment records to indicate where young children and lead lines coexist. A harm metric of estimated exposure-years is described at the parcel level, which can then be aggregated to the project level and minimized globally by posing project selection as a 0/1 knapsack problem. Simplifying for use by nonexperts, the implied linear programming relaxation is solved with the greedy algorithm; ordering projects by benefit cost ratio produces a priority list that planners can then consider holistically alongside harder to quantify factors.

Increasingly, the results of machine learning drive critical decisions in applications related to healthcare and biomedicine. Such health-related applications are often sensitive, and thus, any security breach would be catastrophic. Naturally, the integrity of the results computed by machine learning is of great importance. Recent research has shown that some machine-learning algorithms can be compromised by augmenting their training datasets with malicious data, leading to a new class of attacks called poisoning attacks. Hindrance of a diagnosis may have life-threatening consequences and could cause distrust. On the other hand, not only may a false diagnosis prompt users to distrust the machine-learning algorithm and even abandon the entire system but also such a false positive classification may cause patient distress. In this paper, we present a systematic, algorithm-independent approach for mounting poisoning attacks across a wide range of machine-learning algorithms and healthcare datasets. The proposed attack procedure generates input data, which, when added to the training set, can either cause the results of machine learning to have targeted errors (e.g., increase the likelihood of classification into a specific class), or simply introduce arbitrary errors ( incorrect classification). These attacks may be applied to both fixed and evolving datasets. They can be applied even when only statistics of the training dataset are available or, in some cases, even without access to the training dataset, although at a lower efficacy. We establish the effectiveness of the proposed attacks using a suite of six machine-learning algorithms and five healthcare datasets. Finally, we present countermeasures against the proposed generic attacks that are based on tracking and detecting deviations in various accuracy metrics, and benchmark their effectiveness.",2168-2194,,,1893-1905, ,  ,

A cancer disease in any of its forms represents a major cause of death worldwide. In cancer diagnosis, classification of different tumor types is of the greatest significance. Accuracy for prediction of various tumor types gives better treatment and minimization of toxicity on patients. Accordingly, creating methodologies that can effectively differentiate between cancer subtypes is essential. This paper presents a new methodology to classify Human cancer diseases based on the gene expression profiles. The proposed methodology combines both Information gain (IG) and Deep Genetic Algorithm (DGA). It first uses IG for feature selection, then uses Genetic Algorithm (GA) for feature reduction and finally uses Genetic Programming (GP) for cancer types' classification. The proposed system is evaluated by classifYing cancer diseases in seven cancer datasets and the results are compared with most recent approaches.",,,978-1-5090-0275-7,181-187, , 11th International Computer Engineering Conference (ICENCO)11th International Computer Engineering Conference (ICENCO) ,

Can we fix the faulty behavior of the RNN by replacing portions associated with the faulty behavior? Recent works on decomposing a fully connected neural network (FCNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) into modules have shown the value of engineering deep models in this manner, which is standard in traditional SE but foreign for deep learning models. However, prior works focus on the image-based multiclass classification problems and cannot be applied to RNN due to (a) different layer structures, (b) loop structures, (c) different types of input-output architectures, and (d) usage of both nonlinear and logistic activation functions. In this work, we propose the first approach to decompose an RNN into modules. We study different types of RNNs, i.e., Vanilla, LSTM, and GRU. Further, we show how such RNN modules can be reused and replaced in various scenarios. We evaluate our approach against 5 canonical datasets (i.e., Math QA, Brown Corpus, Wiki-toxicity, Clinc OOS, and Tatoeba) and 4 model variants for each dataset. We found that decomposing a trained model has a small cost (Accuracy: -0.6%, BLEU score: +0.10%).

This research adopted AMiCA data encompassing significant amount of cyberbullying context and structured annotation process. Textual, sentiment and emotional, static and contextual word embeddings, psycholinguistics, term lists, and toxicity features were used in the conventional Machine Learning approach.

However, despite providing solutions to many societal problems and challenges, NMs are associated with adverse effects with potential severe damages towards biological species and their ecosystems. Particularly, it has been confirmed that NMs may induce serious genotoxic effects on various biological targets. Given the difficulties of experimental assays for estimating the genotoxicity of many NMs on diverse biological targets, development of alternative methodologies is crucial to establish their level of safety. In silico modelling approaches, such as Quantitative Structure-Toxicity Relationships (QSTR), are now considered a promising solution for such purpose. In this work, a perturbation theory machine learning (PTML) based QSTR approach is proposed for predicting the genotoxicity of metal oxide NMs under various experimental assay conditions. The application of such perturbation approach to 6084 NM-NM pair cases, set up from 78 unique NMs, afforded a final PTML-QSTR model with an accuracy better than 96% for both training and test sets. This model was then used to predict the genotoxicity of some NMs not included in the modelling dataset. The results for this independent data set were in excellent agreement with the experimental ones. Overall, that thus suggests that the derived PTML-QSTR model is a reliable in silico tool to rapidly and cost-efficiently assess the genotoxicity of metal oxide NMs. Finally, and most importantly, the model provides important insights regarding the mechanism of the genotoxicity triggered by these NMs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

It is inevitable that biota will be exposed to nanomaterials, through intentional administration or inadvertent contact under such circumstances. Therefore, a thorough investigation of the potential nanotoxicity of MONMs at the nano-bio-eco interface is urgently needed. In general, nanomaterials interact with their surrounding environments, biotic and abiotic, immediately upon introduction into the environment. The behavior and fate of MONMs are influenced by the dynamics of the environment. Thus, understanding the interactions at the nano-bio-eco interface is necessary for selecting and designing MONMs with minimum adverse impacts. Despite the limitations of currently available techniques, careful characterization of nanomaterials and the choosing of methodologies that promote further risk assessment promise more reliable and accurate data output. Conventional toxicological analysis techniques lack the power to handle the large datasets generated from in vitro/in vivo observations. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the recent experimental and theoretical studies on the toxicity of MONMs mediated by two-way or three-way interactions.

Factor analysis has the potential to identify an optimal number of latent factors (i.e., symptom groups). However, the ultimate goal of treatment response modeling is to understand the relationship between treatment variables such as radiation dose and symptom groups resulting from FA. Hence, it is crucial to identify clinically more relevant symptom groups and improved response variables from those symptom groups for a quantitative analysis.Objectives: The goal of this study is to design a computational method for finding clinically relevant symptom groups from PROs and to test associations between symptom groups and radiation dose.Methods: We propose a novel approach where exploratory factor analysis is followed by confirmatory factor analysis to determine the relevant number of symptom groups. We also propose to use a combination of symptoms in a symptom group identified as a new response variable in linear regression analysis to investigate the relationship between the symptom group and dose-volume variables.Results: We analyzed patient-reported gastrointestinal symptom profiles from 3 datasets in prostate cancer patients treated with radiotherapy. The final structural model of each dataset was validated using the other two datasets and compared to four other existing FA methods. Our systematic EFA-CFA approach provided clinically more relevant solutions than other methods, resulting in new clinically relevant outcome variables that enabled a quantitative analysis. As a result, statistically significant correlations were found between some dose volume variables to relevant anatomic structures and symptom groups identified by FA.Conclusions: Our proposed method can aid in the process of understanding PROs and provide a basis for improving our understanding of radiation-induced side effects.",0026-1270,,,431-439, ,  ,

For both research and safety regulation purposes, it is of high importance to develop computational methods to accurately predict the potential toxicity of peptides within the vast number of candidate peptides. Results: In this study, we proposed ATSE, a peptide toxicity predictor by exploiting structural and evolutionary information based on graph neural networks and attention mechanism. More specifically, it consists of four modules: (i) a sequence processing module for converting peptide sequences to molecular graphs and evolutionary profiles, (ii) a feature extraction module designed to learn discriminative features from graph structural information and evolutionary information, (iii) an attention module employed to optimize the features and (iv) an output module determining a peptide as toxic or non-toxic, using optimized features from the attention module. Conclusion: Comparative studies demonstrate that the proposed ATSE significantly outperforms all other competing methods. We found that structural information is complementary to the evolutionary information, effectively improving the predictive performance. Importantly, the data-driven features learned by ATSE can be interpreted and visualized, providing additional information for further analysis.

Thus, the development of comprehensive computational methods (e.g., read-across methods) for filling data gaps that meet realistic data needs is crucial. The present study proposes a new quantitative read-across approach based on linear algebra (i.e., one/two-point-slope formula) and one of the most widely used unsupervised pattern recognition methods (i.e., principal component analysis). The applicability and usefulness of the newly developed read-across algorithm for pre-screening hazard assessment of nanomaterials are confirmed by using three literature nanotoxicity datasets. The findings from this study clearly indicate that the proposed read-across approach provides reasonably accurate and statistically significant results of estimations of nanotoxicity data.

To search for malicious web pages, the first step is typically to use a crawler to collect URLs that are live on the Internet. Then, fast prefiltering techniques are employed to reduce the amount of pages that need to be examined by more precise, but slower, analysis tools (such as honeyclients). While effective, these techniques require a substantial amount of resources. A key reason is that the crawler encounters many pages on the web that are benign, that is, the toxicity of the stream of URLs being analyzed is low.In this paper, we present EVILSEED, an approach to search the web more efficiently for pages that are likely malicious. EVILSEED starts from an initial seed of known, malicious web pages. Using this seed, our system automatically generates search engines queries to identify other malicious pages that are similar or related to the ones in the initial seed. By doing so, EVILSEED leverages the crawling infrastructure of search engines to retrieve URLs that are much more likely to be malicious than a random page on the web. In other words EVILSEED increases the toxicity of the input URL stream. Also, we envision that the features that EVILSEED presents could be directly applied by search engines in their prefilters. We have implemented our approach, and we evaluated it on a large-scale dataset. The results show that EVILSEED is able to identify malicious web pages more efficiently when compared to crawler-based approaches.",1081-6011,,978-0-7695-4681-0,428-442, , 33rd IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP)33rd IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP) ,

The radiotherapy dosage quantity is limited by toxicity in organs with de-novo genitourinary toxicity occurrence remaining unperturbed. Estimation of the urethral radiation dose via anatomical contouring may improve our understanding of genitourinary toxicity and its related symptoms. Yet, urethral delineation remains an expert-dependent and time-consuming procedure. In this study, we aim to develop a fully automated segmentation tool for the prostatic urethra.Materials and Methods: This study incorporated 939 patients' T2-weighted MRI scans (train/validation/test/excluded: 657/141/140/1 patients), including in-house and public PROSTATE-x datasets, and their corresponding ground truth urethral contours from an expert genitourinary radiologist. The AI model was developed using MONAI framework and was based on a 3D-UNet. AI model performance was determined by Dice score (volume-based) and the Centerline Distance (CLD) between the prediction and ground truth centers (slice-based). All predictions were compared to ground truth in a systematic failure analysis to elucidate the model's strengths and weaknesses. The Wilcoxon-rank sum test was used for pair-wise comparison of group differences.Results: The overall organ-adjusted Dice score for this model was 0.61 and overall CLD was 2.56 mm. When comparing prostates with symmetrical (n = 117) and asymmetrical (n = 23) benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH), the AI model performed better on symmetrical prostates compared to asymmetrical in both Dice score (0.64 vs. 0.51 respectively, p < 0.05) and mean CLD (2.3 mm vs. 3.8 mm respectively, p < 0.05). When calculating location-specific performance, the performance was highest at the apex and lowest at the base location of the prostate for Dice and CLD. Dice location dependence: symmetrical (Apex, Mid, Base: 0.69 vs. 0.67 vs. 0.54 respectively, p < 0.05) and asymmetrical (Apex, Mid, Base: 0.68 vs. 0.52 vs. 0.39 respectively, p < 0.05).

However, previous approaches which apply RL to open-domain dialog generation do so at the word level, making it difficult for the model to learn proper credit assignment for long-term conversational rewards.

However, it is challenging to locate the prostatic urethra in planning computed tomography (pCT). In the present study, we developed a multiatlas-based auto-segmentation method for prostatic urethra identification using deformable image registration accuracy prediction with machine learning (ML) and assessed its feasibility.Methods We examined 120 patients with prostate cancer treated with IMRT. All patients underwent temporary urinary catheter placement for identification and contouring of the prostatic urethra in pCT images (ground truth). Our method comprises the following three steps: (a) select four atlas datasets from the atlas datasets using the deformable image registration (DIR) accuracy prediction model, (b) deform them by structure-based DIR, (3) and propagate urethra contour using displacement vector field calculated by the DIR. In (a), for identifying suitable datasets, we used the trained support vector machine regression (SVR) model and five feature descriptors (e.g., prostate volume) to increase DIR accuracy. This method was trained/validated using 100 patients and performance was evaluated within an independent test set of 20 patients. Fivefold cross-validation was used to optimize the hype parameters of the DIR accuracy prediction model. We assessed the accuracy of our method by comparing it with those of two others: Acostas method-based patient selection (previous study method, by Acosta et al.), and the Waterman's method (defines the prostatic urethra based on the center of the prostate, by Waterman et al.). We used the centerlines distance (CLD) between the ground truth and the predicted prostatic urethra as the evaluation index.Results The CLD in the entire prostatic urethra was 2.09 +/- 0.89 mm (our proposed method), 2.77 +/- 0.99 mm (Acosta et al., P = 0.022), and 3.47 +/- 1.19 mm (Waterman et al., P < 0.001); our proposed method showed the highest accuracy.

Although deep learning has shown proven advantages in the detection of pneumoconiosis, it remains challenging in pneumoconiosis staging due to the stage ambiguity of pneumoconiosis and noisy samples caused by misdiagnosis when they are used in training deep learning models. In this article, we propose a fully deep learning pneumoconiosis staging paradigm that comprises a segmentation procedure and a staging procedure. The segmentation procedure extracts lung fields in chest radiographs through an Asymmetric Encoder-Decoder Network (AED-Net) that can mitigate the domain shift between multiple datasets. The staging procedure classifies the lung fields into four stages through our proposed deep log-normal label distribution learning and focal staging loss. The two cascaded procedures can effectively solve the problem of model overfitting caused by stage ambiguity and noisy labels of pneumoconiosis. Besides, we collect a clinical chest radiograph dataset of pneumoconiosis from the certified radiologist's diagnostic reports.

This study aims to probe the structural and physicochemical attributes responsible for higher toxicity of dental mono- mers, using quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) modeling approaches. Methods: A regression-based linear single-target QSAR (st-QSAR) model was developed with a comparatively small dataset containing 39 compounds, the cytotoxicity of which has been assessed over the Hela S3 cell line. By contrast, a classification-based multi-target QSAR model was developed with 138 compounds, the cytotoxicity of which has been re- ported against 18 different cell lines. Both models were set up following rigorous validation protocols confirming their statistical significance and robustness. Results: The performance of the linear mt-QSAR model, developed with various feature selection and post-selection similarity searching-based schemes, superseded that of all non-linear models produced with six machine learning methods by hyperparameter opti- mization. The final derived st-QSAR and mt-QSAR linear models are shown to be highly predictive, as well as revealing the crucial structural and physicochemical factors re- sponsible for higher cytotoxicity of the dental monomers. Significance: This study is the first attempt on unveiling the cytotoxicity of dental mono- mers over several cell lines by means of a single multi-target QSAR model. Further, such a model is ready to get widespread applicability in the screening of new monomers, judging from its almost accurate predictions over diverse experimental assay conditions.

In addition to providing a robust means of identifier conversion, BRM also incorporates a suite of microRNA (miRNA)-target databases upon which to query target genes or to perform reverse target lookups using gene identifiers.ResultsBRM has the capability to perform cross-species identifier lookups across common identifier types, directly integrate datasets across platform or species by performing identifier retrievals in the background, and retrieve miRNA targets from multiple databases simultaneously and integrate the resulting gene targets with experimental mRNA data. Here we use workflows provided in BRM to integrate RNA sequencing data across species to identify common biomarkers of exposure after treatment of human lung cells and zebrafish to benzo[a]pyrene (BAP). We further use the miRNA Target workflow to experimentally determine the role of miRNAs as regulators of BAP toxicity and identify the predicted functional consequences of miRNA-target regulation in our system. The output from BRM can easily and directly be uploaded to freely available visualization tools for further analysis. From these examples, we were able to identify an important role for several miRNAs as potential regulators of BAP toxicity in human lung cells associated with cell migration, cell communication, cell junction assembly and regulation of cell death.ConclusionsOverall, BRM provides bioinformatics tools to assist biologists having minimal programming skills with analysis and integration of high-content omics' data from various transcriptomic and proteomic platforms.

Hospitalizations have increased over the past decade, though not uniformly across childhood cancer diagnoses. Analysis of the reasons for admission of children with cancer could enhance comparison of resource use between cancers, and allow clinical practice data to be interpreted more readily. Such comparisons using nationwide data sources are difficult because of numerous subdivisions in the International Classification of Diseases Clinical Modification (ICD-9) system and inherent complexities of treatments. This study aimed to develop a systematic approach to classifying cancer-related admissions in administrative data into categories that reflected clinical practice and predicted resource use.Methods: We developed a multistep algorithm to stratify indications for childhood cancer admissions in the Kids Inpatient Databases from 2003, 2006 and 2009 into clinically meaningful categories. This algorithm assumed that primary discharge diagnoses of cancer or cytopenia were insufficient, and relied on procedure codes and secondary diagnoses in these scenarios. Clinical Classification Software developed by the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project was first used to sort thousands of ICD-9 codes into 5 mutually exclusive diagnosis categories and 3 mutually exclusive procedure categories, and validation was performed by comparison with the ICD-9 codes in the final admission indication. Mean cost, length of stay, and costs per day were compared between categories of indication for admission.Results: A cohort of 202,995 cancer-related admissions was grouped into four categories of indication for admission: chemotherapy (N=77,791, 38%), to undergo a procedure (N=30,858, 15%), treatment for infection (N=30,380, 15%), or treatment for other toxicities (N=43,408, 21.4%). The positive predictive value for the algorithm was >95% for each category. Admissions for procedures had higher mean hospital costs, longer hospital stays, and higher costs per day compared with other admission reasons (p<0.001).Conclusions: This is the first description of a method for grouping indications for childhood cancer admission within an administrative dataset into clinically relevant categories. This algorithm provides a framework for more detailed analyses of pediatric hospitalization data by cancer type.",,1472-6947,,, ,  ,

Systematic high-throughput screening approaches produce a vast amount of data that needs to be quantified automatically. To address this problem, we present an extended version of the open-source MATLAB toolbox Gait-CAD providing integrated tools for automated image analysis, video object tracking and data mining. Gait-CAD offers a convenient graphical user interface (GUI) and is shipped with a great selection of predefined, customizable plugins for both image analysis and data mining. The plugin-based architecture and templates for customized tools provide easy expandability in order to develop comprehensive data-analysis pipelines. Process automation via batch-files and macro recording functionality enables the handling of large datasets like multi-dimensional 2D or 3D images and videos. The scope of the presented tools ranges from automated high-throughput toxicity testing in zebrafish embryos to cellular analysis tasks in developmental biology. In both examples, the toolbox is successfully applied for pre-processing, normalization, segmentation and tracking of spatio-temporal microscopy images, as well as for subsequent data mining and report generation. As automatically acquired images tend to differ in each recording, researchers can significantly accelerate parameter adjustments, process automation and result visualization by using the presented software. The toolbox is not limited to these applications, but they already reveal the great potential of the extended Gait-CAD release.

However training a single deep neural network for multiple organs is highly sensitive to class imbalance and variability in size between several structures within the head and neck region. In this paper, we propose a single-class segmentation model for each OAR in order to handle class imbalance issues during training across output classes (one class per structure), where there exists a severe disparity between 12 OAR. Based on a U-net architecture, we present a transfer learning approach between similar OAR to leverage common learned features, as well as a simple weight averaging strategy to initialize a model as the average of multiple models, each trained on a separate organ. Experiments performed on an internal dataset of 200 H&N cancer patients treated with external beam radiotherapy, show the proposed model presents a significant improvement compared to the baseline multi-organ segmentation model, which attempts to simultaneously train several OAR. The proposed model yields an overall Dice score of 0.75 +/- 0.12, by using both transfer learning across OAR and a weight averaging strategy, indicating that a reasonable segmentation performance can be achieved by leveraging additional data from surrounding structures, limiting the uncertainty in ground-truth annotations.",1945-7928,,978-1-6654-1246-9,1360-1364, , 18th IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI)18th IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) ,

It is dif-ficult for users to reduce their internet/online communications, as the flow of information increases everyday. While the free flow of information benefits online communications, the high toxicity of online communication is a drawback. Toxic texts are described as disrespectful or insulting messages that make the recipient feel uncomfortable. Deep Learning based Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have given exceptional outcomes in Computer Vision Domain, and AlexNet has proven to be the leading architecture in image classification and object detection problems. This article presents a 3-tier CNN architecture that is inspired by the AlexNet model to classify the toxic comments on the Wikipedia forum available in the Google Jigsaw dataset. Fast text-crawl-300d-2 m is used to formulate the pre-trained word embeddings matrix. The Exponential Linear Unit (ELU) activation function is applied in the Convolutional blocks for faster convergence. Dropout is used sufficiently along with different layers of the network to prevent overfitting. From the simulation and subsequent comparative analysis, it is found that the proposed model achieved a decent average accuracy of 98.505% and an average F1 score of 0.79.

Methods used for segmenting tumor from normal tissue, such as threshold boundaries using a fraction of the standardized uptake value (SUV), are subject to uncertainties. The issue of respiratory motion in the thorax confounds the problem of accurate target definition. In this work, we evaluate how changing the PET-defined target volume by varying the threshold value in the segmentation process impacts target and normal lung tissue doses. For each of eight lung cancer patients we retrospectively generated multiple PET-target volumes; each target volume corresponds to those voxels with intensities above a given threshold level, defined by a percentage of the maximum voxel intensity. PET-defined targets were compared to those from CT; CT targets comprise a composite volume generated from breath-hold inhale and exhale datasets; the CT dataset therefore also includes the extents of tumor motion. Treatment plans using Monte Carlo dose calculation were generated for all targets; the dose uniformity was approximately 100 +/- 5% within the internal target volume (ITV) ( formed by a uniform 8-mm expansion of the composite gross target volume (GTV)). In all cases differences were observed in the generalized equivalent uniform doses (gEUDs) to the targets and in the mean lung doses (MLDs) and normal tissue complication probabilities (NTCPs) to the normal lung tissues. The magnitudes of the dose differences were found to depend on the target volume, location, and amount of irradiated normal lung tissue, and in many instances were clinically meaningful ( greater than a single 2 Gy fraction). For those patients studied, results indicate that accurate dosimetry using PET volumes is highly dependent on accurate target segmentation. Further study with correlation to clinical outcome will be helpful in determining how to apply these various PET and CT volumes in treatment planning, to potentially improve local tumor control and reduce normal tissue toxicities.",1526-9914,,,65-76, ,  ,

Because of the associated toxicity from whole brain radiotherapy, more advanced treatment planning techniques prioritize hippocampal avoidance, which depends on an accurate segmentation of the small and complexly shaped hippocampus. To achieve accurate segmentation of the anterior and posterior regions of the hippocampus from T1 weighted (T1w) MR images, we developed a novel model, Hippo-Net, which uses a cascaded model strategy. The proposed model consists of two major parts: (1) a localization model is used to detect the volume-of-interest (VOI) of hippocampus. (2) An end-to-end morphological vision transformer network (Franchietal2020Pattern Recognit.102107246, Ranemetal2022 IEEE/CVF Conf. on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW) pp 3710-3719) is used to perform substructures segmentation within the hippocampus VOI. The substructures include the anterior and posterior regions of the hippocampus, which are defined as the hippocampus proper and parts of the subiculum. The vision transformer incorporates the dominant features extracted from MR images, which are further improved by learning-based morphological operators. The integration of these morphological operators into the vision transformer increases the accuracy and ability to separate hippocampus structure into its two distinct substructures. A total of 260 T1w MRI datasets from medical segmentation decathlon dataset were used in this study. We conducted a five-fold cross-validation on the first 200 T1w MR images and then performed a hold-out test on the remaining 60 T1w MR images with the model trained on the first 200 images. In five-fold cross-validation, the Dice similarity coefficients were 0.900 ± 0.029 and 0.886 ± 0.031 for the hippocampus proper and parts of the subiculum, respectively.

However, these requirements are usually beyond the reach of conventional rigid silicon technologies. In this regard, printed electronics offers a promising alternative. Combined with neuromorphic computing, printed neuromorphic circuits offer not only the aforementioned properties, but also compensate for some of the weaknesses of printed electronics, such as manufacturing variations, low device count, and high latency. Generally, (printed) neuromorphic circuits express their functionality through printed resistor crossbars to emulate matrix multiplication, and nonlinear circuitry to express activation functions. The values of the former are usually learned, while the latter is designed beforehand and considered fixed in training for all tasks. The additive manufacturing feature of printed electronics allows the design of highly-bespoke designs. In the case of printed neuromorphic circuits, the circuit is optimized to a particular dataset. Moreover, we explore an approach to learn not only the values of the crossbar resistances, but also the parameterization of the nonlinear components for a bespoke implementation. While providing additional flexibility of the functionality to be expressed, this will also allow an increased robustness against printing variation. The experiments show that the accuracy and robustness of printed neuromorphic circuits can be improved by 26% and 75% respectively under 10% variation of circuit components.",1530-1591,,979-8-3503-9624-9,, ," Design, Automation and Test in Europe Conference and Exhibition (DATE)Design, Automation and Test in Europe Conference and Exhibition (DATE) ",

The only approved therapies for RSV are the monoclonal antibodies palivizumab and its derivative motavizumab. Both treatments are expensive and require a hospital setting for administration. A vaccine represents a safe, effective and cheaper alternative for preventing RSV infection. In silico prediction methods have proven to be valuable in speeding up the process of vaccine design. In this study, reverse vaccinology methods were used to predict the cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) epitopes from the entire proteome of RSV strain A. From amongst 3402 predicted binders to 12 high frequency alleles from the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB), 567 had positive processing scores while 327 epitopes were predicted to be immunogenic. A thorough examination of the 327 epitopes for possible antigenicity, allergenicity and toxicity resulted in 95 epitopes with desirable properties. A BLASTp analysis revealed 94 unique and non-homologous epitopes that were subjected to molecular docking across the 12 high frequency alleles. The final dataset of 70 epitopes contained 13 experimentally proven and 57 unique epitopes from a total of 11 RSV proteins. From our findings on selected T-cell-specific RSV antigen epitopes, notably the four epitopes confirmed to exhibit stable binding by molecular dynamics.

Research in this area often evaluates proposed improvements to models, interfaces, or workflows by demonstrating improved predictive performance on ground truth labels. However, this practice overlooks a key difference between human judgments and model predictions. Whereas humans commonly reason about broader phenomena of interest in a decision including latent constructs that are not directly observable, such as disease status, the toxicity of online comments, or future job performance - predictive models target proxy labels that are readily available in existing datasets. Predictive models' reliance on simplistic proxies for these nuanced phenomena makes them vulnerable to various sources of statistical bias. In this paper, we identify five sources of target variable bias that can impact the validity of proxy labels in human-AI decision-making tasks. We develop a causal framework to disentangle the relationship between each bias and clarify which are of concern in specific human-AI decision-making tasks. We demonstrate how our framework can be used to articulate implicit assumptions made in prior modeling work, and we recommend evaluation strategies for verifying whether these assumptions hold in practice. We then leverage our framework to re-examine the designs of prior human subjects experiments that investigate human-AI decision-making, finding that only a small fraction of studies examine factors related to target variable bias. We conclude by discussing opportunities to better address target variable bias in future research.",,,978-1-4503-7252-7,688-704, ," 6th ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (FAccT)6th ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (FAccT) ",

First, the three critical steps in the preparation of tissue extracts for NMR analysis are described, including both a perchloric acid protocol for the extraction of polar metabolites, and a methanol:chloroform protocol for extraction of polar and lipophilic metabolites. Then a series of NMR experiments are described including a standard one-dimensional (1D) 1H NMR study, a 1D 1H Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill spin-echo experiment, and a two-dimensional 1H-1H J-resolved NMR experiment.

This study aimed to reveal the risk of Cd accumulation in soil and wheat/maize systems, with a specific focus on the source-specific ecological risk, human health risk and Cd enrichment model. For this we investigated more than 6100 paired soil and grain samples with 216 datasets including soil Cd contents, soil pH and grain Cd contents of 85 sites from China. The results showed that mining activities, sewage irrigation, industrial activities and agricultural practices were the critical factors causing Cd accumulation in wheat and maize cultivated sites. Thereinto, mining activities contributed to a higher Cd accumulation risk in the southwest China and Middle Yellow River regions; sewage irrigation influenced the Cd accumulation in the North China Plain. In addition, the investigated sites were classified into different categories by comparing their soil and grain Cd contents with the Chinese soil screening values and food safety values, respectively. Cd enrichment models were developed to predict the Cd levels in wheat and maize grains. The results showed that the models exhibited a good performance for predicting the grain Cd contents among safe and warning sites of wheat ( R 2 = 0.61 and 0.72, respectively); while the well-fitted model for maize was prone to the overestimated sites ( R 2 = 0.77).

Novel statistical methods for linking health, exposure, and hazards are required to underpin the development of public health tracking. A test for the association between spatial contours of health risk and exposure is outlined. This test is examined using, as an example, the spatial contours of congenital malformation risk obtained from a routine dataset in the vicinity of a landfill site and an exposure model based on exponential reduction with distance from the site. Spatial contours of risk of congenital malformation were simulated using the exposure model stated and a given population pattern. These were compared with the corresponding expected risk derived from routine birth data to yield relative risk contours. For each simulation three test statistics were devised: the slope of the regression line of standardized relative risk on exposure level, the proportion of standardized relative risks above zero, and the mean standardized relative risk of individuals not subject to exposure. The distributions of these test statistics (under the null no exposure from site and alternative hypotheses) were determined from a simulation exercise. A comparison of receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves between those relating to the proposed test and those relating to a widely used method proposed by Stone (1988) demonstrated our test to be more efficient.

The ever increasing number of datasets and diversity of experimental conditions make the handling and analysis of biodistribution data difficult. This work sought to facilitate the statistical analysis of a large number of datasets and the comparison of results from diverse experimental conditions. Functional modules were developed using the open-source programming language R to facilitate specific operations: descriptive statistics, visual comparison, curve fitting, and implementation of biokinetic models. In addition, the structure of the datasets was harmonized using the same table format. Analysis outputs can be written in text files and updated data can be written in the consistent table format.

The resulting computational tool was applied using data derived from wound contamination experiments conducted under different conditions.In facilitating biodistribution data handling and statistical analyses, this computational tool ensures faster analyses and a better reproducibility compared with the use of multiple office software applications. Furthermore, re-analysis of archival data and comparison of data from different sources is made much easier.

The initialization strategy consists of a complete linearization of the network with only one neuron unit around an equilibrium point and the determination of the initial weights through the maximum approximation of the linearized model to the Optimal Linear Regressor whose solution can be obtained analytically. The constructive algorithm performs a gradual increase in the number of hidden units in such a way that at each training only weights associated with new hidden units are randomly initialized, while weights obtained from previous training are used as initial guess for the subsequent ones. The proposed method was compared to the classical random initialization method and to the Extreme Learning Machine (a typical gradient-free learning algorithm), both of which also involve a constructive approach to define the final network.

In this study, I assembled a dataset of 319 viral overlapping genes, which included 82 overlaps whose expression is experimentally known and the respective 237 homologs. Principal component analysis revealed that overlapping genes have a common pattern of nucleotide and amino acid composition. Discriminant analysis separated overlapping from non-overlapping genes with an accuracy of 97%. When applied to overlapping genes with known genealogy, it separated ancestral from de novo frames with an accuracy close to 100%. This high discriminant power was crucial to computationally design variants of de novo viral proteins known to possess selective anticancer toxicity (apoptin) or protection against neurodegeneration (X protein), as well as to detect two new potential overlapping genes in the genome of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.",0042-6822,1089-862X,,51-66, ,  ,

As per research, it provides subsistence for around 70% of rural households. In terms of agricultural output and exports, India ranks second and ninth, respectively. However, it accomplishes the first position globally in terms of cotton exports thereby adequately contributing to the economy of the country. However, it has been documented that various crops especially cotton plants are severely harmed by various pests, extreme climatic variations, nutrient inadequacy and toxicity, and so on. Cotton plant diseases cause a wide range of illnesses ranging from bacterial to nutritional deficiency giving a hard time for the human eye to recognize. However, most of the researchers have considered only a few types of cotton leaf diseases and excluded many. Keeping these constraints in consideration, this research seeks to aid the detection of these diseases by employing deep learning paradigms. The research begins with acquiring a near-balanced dataset with 22 leaf disease types including bacterial, fungal, viral, nutrient deficiency, etc. followed by data augmentation to boost the performance of the models. Many algorithms were tested, however, CNN happens to be very efficient and productive. The proposed model when evaluated on the test set achieves an accuracy of 99.39% with a negligible error rate, thus outperforming all the existing approaches by consuming less computational time.

Given their graphs, there is increasing need for classifying small molecules to predict their properties such as activity, toxicity or mutagenicity. Using subtrees as feature set for graph classification in kernel methods has been shown to perform well in classifying small molecules. It is also well-known that feature selection can improve the performance of classifiers. However, most of the graph kernels are not selective in choosing which subtrees to include in the set of features. Instead, they use all subtrees of a certain property as their feature set. We argue that not all the latter features are needed for effective classification. In this paper, we investigate the effect of selecting subset of the subtrees as features for graph kernels, i.e., we try to identify and keep useful features; all the remaining subtrees are eliminated.

Statistical approaches, such as the multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) and generalized MDR (GMDR), have recently been proposed to test the joint association of multiple genetic variants with either dichotomous or continuous traits. In this study, we propose a novel Forward U-Test to evaluate the combined effect of multiple loci on quantitative traits with consideration of gene-gene/gene-environment interactions. In this new approach, a U-Statistic-based forward algorithm is first used to select potential disease-susceptibility loci and then a weighted U-statistic is used to test the joint association of the selected loci with the disease. Through a simulation study, we found the Forward U-Test outperformed GMDR in terms of greater power. Aside from that, our approach is less computationally intensive, making it feasible for high-dimensional gene-gene/gene-environment research. We illustrate our method with a real data application to nicotine dependence (ND), using three independent datasets from the Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment. Our gene-gene interaction analysis of 155 SNPs in 67 candidate genes identified two SNPs, rs16969968 within gene CHRNA5 and rs1122530 within gene NTRK2, jointly associated with the level of ND (P-value = 5.31e-7). The association, which involves essential interaction, is replicated in two independent datasets with P-values of 1.08e-5 and 0.02, respectively.

To realize quick, accurate, and non-destructive detection of heavy metals in mussels, a new method based on near-infrared reflection spectroscopy was developed in this study. Spectral data from 900 nm to 1700 nm of non-contaminated mussels and mussels contaminated with Cd, Zn, Pb, and Cu were collected using a near-infrared spectrometer. After pre-processing spectral data with multiplicative scatter correction, wavelength selection algorithms based on consistency measures of neighborhood rough sets were used to extract wavelengths for distinguishing non-contaminated and contaminated mussels. A constrained difference extreme learning machine was established as a classification model to detect contaminated mussels. In the proposed model, the weight and bias of the hidden layers are calculated by the difference vectors of samples between classes instead of being randomly selected. The results indicate that the proposed model performs significantly well in differentiating between non-contaminated and contaminated mussels. The average classification accuracy of 50 randomly generated test datasets reaches 97.53%, 95.67%, 99.00%, and 98.80% for the detection of Zn, Pb, Cd, and Cu contamination, respectively.

PATRN incorporates a standard vocabulary for describing isolate metadata and provides a representational schema for a prototypic data exchange standard using a novel data loading wizard for aggregation of assay and attribution information. PATRN currently houses expert-curated, high-quality foundational datasets consisting of published experimental results from conventional assays and next generation analysis platforms for isolates of Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, and Salmonella, Shigella, Vibrio and Cronobacter species. A suite of computational tools for data mining, clustering, and graphical representation is available. Within PATRN, the public curated data repository is complemented by a secure private workspace for user-driven analyses, and for sharing data among collaborators. To demonstrate the data curation, loading wizard features, and analytical capabilities of PATRN, three use-case scenarios are presented. Use-case scenario one is a comparison of the distribution and prevalence of plasmid-encoded virulence factor genes among 249 Cronobacter strains with similar attributes to that of nine Cronobacter isolates from recent cases obtained between March and October, 2010-2011. To highlight PATRN's data management and trend finding tools, analysis of datasets, stored in PATRN as part of an ongoing surveillance project to identify the predominant molecular serogroups among Cronobacter sakazakii isolates observed in the USA is shown. Use-case scenario two demonstrates the secure workspace available for private users to upload and analyze sensitive data, and for collating cross-platform datasets to identify and validate congruent datapoints. SNP datasets from WGS assemblies and pan-genome microarrays are analyzed in a combinatorial fashion to determine relatedness of 33 Salmonella enterica strains to six strains collected as part of an outbreak investigation. Use-case scenario three utilizes published surveillance results that describe the incidence and sources of O157:H7 E. coli isolates associated with a produce pre-harvest surveillance study that occurred during 2002-2006.

We rely on rich dataset from a 2006 national survey of U.S. households (N = 2136). Our internal variables include a modified version of the New Ecological Paradigm scale, a moral norm scale based on Schwartz's norm-activation model, and indicators of social pressure for recycling. External variables consist of detailed socio-demographic characteristics. Our logit model shows that external variables do not help characterizing people with e-waste recycling experience, except that they tend to have larger families or to be over 60 years old. However, knowing that e-waste contains potentially toxic materials, recycling conventional materials at work or at school, and especially having strong moral norms helps explain e-waste recycling behavior. Using a generalized ordered logit model, we then show that the most important variables for explaining household willingness to recycle e-waste are internal variables, followed by recycling convenience, knowledge of the potential toxicity of e-waste, prior e-waste recycling experience, as well as gender and marital status; education, age, and ethnicity play only a minor role, while knowledge of e-waste laws, availability of curbside recycling for domestic waste, and income are not statistically significant. Our results suggest that e-waste recycling can be stimulated by promoting moral norms, educating the public about the benefits of recycling e-waste, and making e-waste recycling more convenient but other measures will likely be necessary to tackle the e-waste problem.

The observation of Tribolium embryos with light sheet-based fluorescence microscopy has multiple advantages over conventional widefield and confocal fluorescence microscopy. Due to the unique properties of a light sheet-based microscope, three dimensional images of living specimens can be recorded with high signal-to-noise ratios and significantly reduced photo-bleaching as well as photo-toxicity along multiple directions over periods that last several days. With more than four years of methodological development and a continuous increase of data, the time seems appropriate to establish standard operating procedures for the usage of light sheet technology in the Tribolium community as well as in the insect community at large. This protocol describes three mounting techniques suitable for different purposes, presents two novel custom-made transgenic Tribolium lines appropriate for long-term live imaging, suggests five fluorescent dyes to label intracellular structures of fixed embryos and provides information on data post-processing for the timely evaluation of the recorded data. Representative results concentrate on long-term live imaging, optical sectioning and the observation of the same embryo along multiple directions. The respective datasets are provided as a downloadable resource. Finally, the protocol discusses quality controls for live imaging assays, current limitations and the applicability of the outlined procedures to other insect species.This protocol is primarily intended for developmental biologists who seek imaging solutions that outperform standard laboratory equipment. It promotes the continuous attempt to close the gap between the technically orientated laboratories/communities, which develop and refine microscopy methodologically, and the life science laboratories/communities, which require 'plug-and-play' solutions to technical challenges.

In The Netherlands the Dutch government and responsible branch organizations [from bakeries (traditional & industrial), flour mills and bakery ingredient producers] signed a covenant to reduce exposure to Hour dust and decrease the prevalence of work-related occupational airway disease. This paper describes a sector wide survey to measure exposure to flour dust, wheat allergens and fungal a-amylase. The results are being used to underpin various elements of the covenant.Methods: A dataset containing 910 personal measurements was compiled from four field studies containing information on exposure and potential determinants. The dataset represents a baseline estimate of exposure for four major flour processing sectors in The Netherlands. Exposure models for all sectors and agents were generated, based on job, tasks and company size, taking into account worker and company as random effect components. Use of control measures and, where possible, their effect were evaluated.Results: Flour dust and enzyme exposures vary strongly between sectors. The job performed and specific tasks were identified as important determinants of exposure. The number of identified control measures during walk-through surveys, and their effectiveness in reduction of dust exposure was generally limited. The exposure models explained significant exposure variability between companies and workers but performed poorly in explaining day to day differences in exposure.Discussion: The dataset serves as a baseline estimate and will be compared with a post intervention survey in the near future. The information obtained on control measures can be used to optimize the intervention scenarios that will be implemented in the different sectors by external occupational hygienists. The predictive exposure models will provide a relevant measure of average personal exposure that will be used in the sector wide health surveillance system.",0003-4878,1475-3162,,293-304, ,  ,

Increased radiation doses could improve local control and overall survival of lung cancer patients, however, this could be challenging without exceeding organs at risk (OAR) dose constraints, especially for patients with advanced-stage disease. Increasing OAR doses could reduce the therapeutic ratio and quality of life. It is therefore important to investigate methods to increase the dose to target volume without exceeding OAR dose constraints. Methods. Gross tumour volume (GTV) was contoured on synthetic computerised tomography (sCT) datasets produced using the Velocity adaptive radiotherapy software for eleven patients. The fractions where GTV volume decreased compared to that prior to radiotherapy (reference plan) were considered for personalised progressive dose escalation. The dose to the adapted GTV (GTV(Adaptive)) was increased until OAR doses were affected (as compared to the original clinical plan). Planning target volume (PTV) coverage was maintained for all plans. Doses were also escalated to the reference plan (GTV(Clinical)) using the same method. Adapted, dose-escalated, plans were combined to estimate accumulated dose, D-99 (dose to 99%) of GTV(Adapted,) PTV D-99 and OAR doses and compared with those in the original clinical plans. Knowledge-based planning (KBP) model was developed to predict D-99 of the adapted GTV with OAR doses and PTV coverage kept similar to the original clinical plans; prediction accuracy and model verification were performed using further data sets. Results. Compared to the original clinical plan, the dose to GTV was significantly increased without exceeding OAR doses. Adaptive dose-escalation increased the average D(99 )to GTV(Adaptive) by 15.1Gy and 8.7Gy compared to the clinical plans. The KBP models were verified and demonstrated prediction accuracy of 0.4% and 0.7% respectively. Conclusion. Progressive adaptive dose escalation can significantly increase the dose to GTV without increasing OAR doses or compromising the dose to microscopic disease. This may increase overall survival without increasing toxicities.",2057-1976,,,, ,  ,

For several of these domains, a typical computational task to be performed is classification. In this work, we explore the hardware cost of inference engines for popular classification algorithms (Multi-Layer Perceptrons, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Logistic Regression, Random Forests and Binary Decision Trees) in EGT and CNT-TFT printed technologies and determine that Decision Trees and SVMs provide a good balance between accuracy and cost. We evaluate conventional Decision Tree and SVM architectures in these technologies and conclude that their area and power overhead must be reduced. We explore, through SPICE and gate-level hardware simulations and multiple working prototypes, several classifier architectures that exploit the unique cost and implementation tradeoffs in printed technologies - a) Bespoke printed classifers that are customized to a model generated for a given application using specific training datasets, b) Lookup-based printed classifiers where key hardware computations are replaced by lookup tables, and c) Analog printed classifiers where some classifier components are replaced by their analog equivalents. Our evaluations show that bespoke implementation of EGT printed Decision Trees has 48.9x lower area (average) and 75.6x lower power (average) than their conventional equivalents; corresponding benefits for bespoke SVMs are 12.8x and 12.7x respectively. Lookup-based Decision Trees outperform their non-lookup bespoke equivalents by 38% and 70%; lookup-based SVMs are better by 8% and 0.6%. Analog printed Decision Trees provide 437 x area and 27x power benefits over digital bespoke counterparts; analog SVMs yield 490x area and 12x power improvements.

However, the application of environmentally friendly copper-based Cs3Cu2Cl5 in memristors has been rarely reported to the authors' knowledge. Herein, multifunctional memristors with the coexistence of non-volatile memory (MS) and volatile threshold switching (TS) behaviors are introduced based on an innovative Ag-In-Zn-S/Cs3Cu2Cl5 heterostructure. The inserted Ag-In-Zn-S quantum dots layer may provide an effective method for guiding the formation of the dominant metallic Ag filaments, resulting in considerably stable and controllable multiple switching behaviors. Additionally, the heterostructure memristor is capable of imitating some essential biological synaptic functions, including long-term potentiation (LTP), long-term depression (LTD), and the short-term memory (STM) to long-term memory (LTM) transition. Furthermore, the famous conditioning Pavlov's dog experiment corresponding to associative learning is electronically simulated by the studied device.

To overcome these problems, this study aimed to develop a deep learning-based automatic auscultatory BP measurement method, and clinically validate its performance. A deep learning-based method that utilized time-frequency characteristics and temporal dependence of segmented Korotkoff sound (KorS) signals and employed convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) network was developed and trained using KorS and cuff pressure signals recorded from 314 subjects. The BPs determined by the manual auscultatory method was used as the reference for each measurement. The measurement error and BP category classification performance of our proposed method were then validated on a separate dataset of 114 subjects. Its performance in comparison with the oscillometric method was also comprehensively analyzed. The deep learning method achieved measurement errors of 0.2 +/- 4.6 mmHg and 0.1 +/- 3.2 mmHg for systolic BP and diastolic BP, respectively, and achieved high sensitivity, specificity and accuracy (all > 90 %) in classifying hypertensive subjects, which were better than those of the traditional oscillometric method.

Major drawbacks of commercially available PFGE analysis programs have been their difficulty in dealing with large datasets and the limited availability of analysis tools. There exists a need to develop new analytical tools for PFGE data mining in order to make full use of valuable data in large surveillance databases.Results: In this study, a software package was developed consisting of five types of bioinformatics approaches exploring and implementing for the analysis and visualization of PFGE fingerprinting. The approaches include PFGE band standardization, Salmonella serotype prediction, hierarchical cluster analysis, distance matrix analysis and two-way hierarchical cluster analysis. PFGE band standardization makes it possible for cross-group large dataset analysis. The Salmonella serotype prediction approach allows users to predict serotypes of Salmonella isolates based on their PFGE patterns. The hierarchical cluster analysis approach could be used to clarify subtypes and phylogenetic relationships among groups of PFGE patterns. The distance matrix and two-way hierarchical cluster analysis tools allow users to directly visualize the similarities/dissimilarities of any two individual patterns and the inter-and intra-serotype relationships of two or more serotypes, and provide a summary of the overall relationships between user-selected serotypes as well as the distinguishable band markers of these serotypes. The functionalities of these tools were illustrated on PFGE fingerprinting data from PulseNet of CDC.Conclusions: The bioinformatics approaches included in the software package developed in this study were integrated with the PFGE database to enhance the data mining of PFGE fingerprints. Fast and accurate prediction makes it possible to elucidate Salmonella serotype information before conventional serological methods are pursued. The development of bioinformatics tools to distinguish the PFGE markers and serotype specific patterns will enhance PFGE data retrieval, interpretation and serotype identification and will likely accelerate source tracking to identify the Salmonella isolates implicated in foodborne diseases.",1471-2105,,,, , 10th Annual Conference of the MidSouth-Computational-Biology-and-Bioinformatics-Society (MCBIOS) on Discovery in a Sea of Data10th Annual Conference of the MidSouth-Computational-Biology-and-Bioinformatics-Society (MCBIOS) on Discovery in a Sea of Data ,

Visual marking of HFOs is highly time-consuming and inevitably subjective, making automatic detection necessary. We compare four existing detectors on the same dataset.Methods: HFOs and baselines were identified by experienced reviewers in intracerebral EEGs from 20 patients. A new feature of our detector to deal with channels where baseline cannot be found is presented. The original and an optimal configuration are implemented. Receiver operator curves, false discovery rate, and channel ranking are used to evaluate performance.Results: All detectors improve performance with the optimal configuration. Our detector had higher sensitivity, lower false positives than the others, and similar false detections. The main difference in performance was in very active channels.Conclusions: Each detector was developed for different recordings and with different aims. Our detector performed better in this dataset, but was developed on data similar to the test data. Moreover, optimizing on a particular data type improves performance in any detector.Significance: Automatic HFO detection is crucial to propel their clinical use as biomarkers of epileptogenic tissue. Comparing detectors on a single dataset is important to analyze their performance and to emphasize the issues involved in validation. (C) 2011 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Its aim is to automatically identify patients that can benefit from an adaptive treatment strategy. The study predominantly addresses dosimetric uncertainties and critical issues caused by motion of hollow organs. 1200 MVCT images of 38 prostate adenocarcinoma cases were analyzed. An automatic daily re-contouring of structures (i.e. rectum, bladder and femoral heads), rigid/deformable registration and dose warping was carried out to simulate dose and volume variations during therapy. Support vector machine, K-means clustering algorithms and similarity index analysis were used to create an unsupervised predictive tool to detect incorrect setup and/or morphological changes as a consequence of inadequate patient preparation due to stochastic physiological changes, supporting clinical decision-making. After training on a dataset that was considered sufficiently dosimetrically stable, the system identified two equally sized macro clusters with distinctly different volumetric and dosimetric baseline properties and defined thresholds for these two clusters. Application to the test cohort resulted in 25% of the patients located outside the two macro clusters thresholds and which were therefore suspected to be dosimetrically unstable. In these patients, over the treatment course, mean volumetric changes of 30 and 40% for rectum and bladder were detected which possibly represents values justifying adjustment of patient preparation, frequent re-planning or a plan-of-the-day strategy. Based on our research, by combining daily IGRT images with rigid/deformable registration and dose warping, it is possible to apply a machine learning approach to the clinical setting obtaining useful information for a decision regarding an individualized adaptive strategy.

The features are extracted from X-rays using deep transfer learning, comprising both low and high-level feature sets. For this, a CNN model pre-trained with a transfer learning from a CheXNet model was initially used to extract deep features from the X-Ray images, then the deep features were mapped to higher-dimensional feature spaces for classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and CNN based feature aggregation methods.

ULDA is a supervised method for feature extraction (FE), discriminant analysis (DA) and biomarker screening based on the Fisher criterion function. While principal component analysis (PCA) searches for directions of maximum variance in the data, ULDA seeks linearly combined variables called uncorrelated discriminant vectors (UDVs). The UDVs maximize the separation among different classes in terms of the Fisher criterion. The performance of ULDA is evaluated and compared with PCA, partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and target projection discriminant analysis (TP-DA) for two datasets, one simulated and one real from a metabolomic study. ULDA showed better discriminatory ability than PCA, PLS-DA and TP-DA. The shortcomings of PCA, PLS-DA and TP-DA are attributed to interference from linear correlations in data. PLS-DA and TP-DA performed successfully for the simulated data, but PLS-DA was slightly inferior to ULDA for the real data. ULDA successfully extracted optimal features for discriminant analysis and revealed potential biomarkers. Furthermore, by means of cross-validation, the classification model obtained by ULDA showed better predictive ability than PCA, PLS-DA and TP-DA.

The nutritional disorder in pears is either due to deficiency of nutrients or toxicity of nutrients. The techniques to identify the nutrients deficiencies include tissue testing, soil analysis, plant analysis, and visual deficiency symptoms. The effects of alfalfa greening, black end, and cork spot are minimised by correcting the calcium nutrition in the pear tree. In this paper, a two-class decision jungle model is proposed for the recognition of calcium deficiency in pears based on a non-invasive approach. The calcium deficiency in pears makes a bumpy fruit surface and leaves yellow color on the affected area than the rest of the skin results in the greyish corky lesion. The nutrient deficiency that results in serious disorders in pears not only influences the plant but also impacts the fruit quality. The introduction of artificial intelligence in the agriculture industry has helped farmers to produce healthier fruits. The artificial intelligence provides a real-time data for the classifier that results in increasing agricultural efficiencies, better crop yields and reduce fruit production costs by facilitating the routine and most complex tasks. The two-class decision jungle model achieves an accuracy of 98% with a database of 1000 samples. The other approaches, such as Boosted decision tree, Bayes point machine, Logistic regression, Neural Network, and SVM, have an accuracy of 92.20%, 84.3%, 72.5%, 82.4%, and 72.5%, respectively for the equivalent datasets.

The efficacy of NST is measured by pathologic complete response (pCR). A patient who attains pCR has significantly enhanced disease-free survival progress. The accurate prediction of pCR in response to a given treatment regimen could increase the likelihood of achieving pCR and prevent toxicities caused by treatments that are not effective. Th early prediction of response to NST can increase the likelihood of survival and help with decisions regarding breast-conserving surgery. An automated NST prediction framework that is able to precisely predict which patient undergoing NST will achieve a pathological complete response (pCR) at an early stage of treatment is needed.

In order to avoid these drawbacks, adaptive therapy can be planned for patients at risk, if the prediction is obtained timely, before or during the early phase of treatment. Artificial intelligence can address the problem, by learning from examples and building classification models. In particular, fuzzy logic has shown its suitability for medical applications, in order to manage uncertain data, and to build transparent rule-based classifiers.In previous works, clinical, dosimetric and image-based features were considered separately, to find different possible predictors of parotid shrinkage. On the other hand, a few works reported possible image-based predictors of xerostomia, while the combination of different types of features has been little addressed.Objective: This paper proposes the application of a novel machine learning approach, based on both statistics and fuzzy logic, aimed at the classification of patients at risk of i) parotid gland shrinkage and ii) 12-months xerostomia. Both problems are addressed with the aim of individuating predictors and models to classify respective outcomes.Methods: Knowledge is extracted from a real dataset of radiotherapy patients, by means of a recently developed method named Likelihood-Fuzzy Analysis, based on the representation of statistical information by fuzzy rule-based models. This method enables to manage heterogeneous variables and missing data, and to obtain interpretable fuzzy models presenting good generalization power (thus high performance), and to measure classification confidence.Numerous features are extracted to characterize patients, coming from different sources, i.e. clinical features, dosimetric parameters, and radiomics-based measures obtained by texture analysis of Computed Tomography images. A learning approach based on the composition of simple models in a more complicated one allows to consider the features separately, in order to identify predictors and models to use when only some data source is available, and obtaining more accurate results when more information can be combined.Results: Regarding parotid shrinkage, a number of good predictors is detected, some already known and confirmed here, and some others found here, in particular among radiomics-based features. A number of models are also designed, some using single features and others involving models composition to improve classification accuracy. In particular, the best model to be used at the initial treatment stage, and another one applicable at the half treatment stage are identified.Regarding 12-months toxicity, some possible predictors are detected, in particular among radiomics-based features. Moreover, the relation between final parotid shrinkage rate and 12-months xerostomia is evaluated.The method is compared to the naive Bayes classifier, which reveals similar results in terms of classification accuracy and best predictors.The interpretable fuzzy rule-based models are explicitly presented, and the dependence between predictors and outcome is explained, thus furnishing in some cases helpful insights about the considered problems.Conclusion: Thanks to the performance and interpretability of the fuzzy classification method employed, predictors of both parotid shrinkage and xerostomia are detected, and their influence on each outcome is revealed. Moreover, models for predicting parotid shrinkage at initial and half radiotherapy stages are found. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The objectives of this study were to (1) study the occurrence of fumonisins in Catalonia (north-eastern region of Spain) and (2) assess the exposure of the Catalonian population to these mycotoxins. Contamination data was provided by a wide survey where 928 individual samples were pooled to analyse 370 composite samples. Fumonisins were extracted and purified using immunoaffinity columns and determined by HPLC with fluorescence detection. The raw consumption data came from a nutritional study specifically designed to assess the dietary intake of the main foodstuffs related to fumonisin contamination for all population age groups. In addition, two specific groups were selected with respect to maize consumption: immigrants and celiac sufferers. Contamination and consumption data were combined by simulation using an essentially parametric-parametric (P-P) method. The P-P method draws sampling values from distribution functions fitted to consumption and contamination datasets. Moreover, to quantify the accuracy and reliability of the statistical estimates, we built related confidence intervals using a Pseudo-Parametric bootstrap method. The results of this study show that fumonisins are commonly found in some commodities on the Catalonian market, such as beer, corn snacks and ethnic foods; however, the values were well below the permitted maximum EU levels.

Integrating clinical, biological, imaging, and treatment-specific data for more accurate prediction of tumor control probabilities or risk of radiation-induced side effects are high-dimensional problems whose solutions could have wide-spread benefits to a diverse patient population-we discuss technical approaches toward this objective. Increasing interest in the above is specifically reflected by the emergence of two nascent fields, which are distinct but complementary: radiogenomics, which broadly seeks to integrate biological risk factors together with treatment and diagnostic information to generate individualized patient risk profiles, and radiomics, which further leverages large-scale imaging correlates and extracted features for the same purpose. We review classical analytical and data-driven approaches for outcomes prediction that serve as antecedents to both radiomic and radiogenomic strategies. Discussion then focuses on uses of conventional and deep machine learning in radiomics. We further consider promising strategies for the harmonization of high-dimensional, heterogeneous multiomics datasets (panomics) and techniques for nonparametric validation of best-fit models.

Recent progress in the quantification of the metabolome through mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) has given rise to high-dimensional biomedical data of specific metabolites that can be leveraged to study their effects in humans. These metabolic interactions can be evaluated using probabilistic graphical models (PGMs), which define conditional dependence and independence between components within and between heterogeneous biomedical datasets. This method allows for the detection and recovery of valuable but latent information that cannot be easily detected by other currently existing methods. Here, we develop a PGM method, referred to as an Integrated Gaussian Graphical Model (IGGM), to incorporate exposure concentrations of seven trace elements arsenic (As), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), cadmium (Cd), zinc (Zn), selenium (Se) and copper (Cu into metabolic networks. We first conducted a simulation study demonstrating that the integration of trace elements into metabolomics data can improve the accuracy of detecting latent interactions of metabolites impacted by exposure in the network. We tested parameters such as sample size and the number of neighboring metabolites of a chosen trace element for their impact on the accuracy of detecting metabolite interactions. We then applied this method to measurements of cord blood plasma metabolites and placental trace elements collected from newborns in the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study (NHBCS).

Yet accurately estimating variability of gene expression measurements in microarray experiments is essential for correctly identifying differentially expressed genes. Several recently developed methods for testing differential expression of genes utilize hierarchical Bayesian models to pool information from multiple genes. We have developed a statistical testing procedure that further improves upon current methods by incorporating the well-documented relationship between the absolute gene expression level and the variance of gene expression measurements into the general empirical Bayes framework.Results: We present a novel Bayesian moderated-T, which we show to perform favorably in simulations, with two real, dual-channel microarray experiments and in two controlled single-channel experiments. In simulations, the new method achieved greater power while correctly estimating the true proportion of false positives, and in the analysis of two publicly-available spike-in experiments, the new method performed favorably compared to all tested alternatives. We also applied our method to two experimental datasets and discuss the additional biological insights as revealed by our method in contrast to the others. The R-source code for implementing our algorithm is freely available at http://eh3.uc.edu/ibmt.Conclusion: We use a Bayesian hierarchical normal model to define a novel Intensity-Based Moderated T-statistic (IBMT). The method is completely data-dependent using empirical Bayes philosophy to estimate hyperparameters, and thus does not require specification of any free parameters. IBMT has the strength of balancing two important factors in the analysis of microarray data: the degree of independence of variances relative to the degree of identity (i.e. t-tests vs. equal variance assumption), and the relationship between variance and signal intensity. When this variance-intensity relationship is weak or does not exist, IBMT reduces to a previously described moderated t-statistic. Furthermore, our method may be directly applied to any array platform and experimental design. Together, these properties show IBMT to be a valuable option in the analysis of virtually any microarray experiment.",1471-2105,,,, ,  ,

However, most of the existing studies focus only on the document- or sentence-level sentiment control, leaving a gap for finer-grained control over the content of generated results. Fine-grained control allows a generated review to express different opinions toward multiple aspects. Some previous works attempted to generate reviews conditioned on aspect-level sentiments, but they usually suffer from low adaptability and the lack of an annotated dataset. To alleviate these problems, we propose a novel pre-trained extended generative model that can dynamically refer to the prompt sentiment, together with an auxiliary classifier that extracts the fine-grained sentiments from the unannotated sentences, thus we conducted training on both annotated and unannotated datasets. We also propose a query-hint mechanism to further guide the generation process toward the aspect-level sentiments at every time step. Experimental results from real-world datasets demonstrated that our model has excellent adaptability in generating aspect-level sentiment-controllable review texts with high sentiment coverage and stable quality since, on both datasets, our model steadily outperforms other baseline models in the metrics of BLEU-4, METETOR, and ROUGE-L etc. The limitation of this work is that we only focus on fine-grained sentiments that are explicitly expressed.

We interpret the task of controllable generation as drawing samples from an energy-based model whose energy values are a linear combination of scores from black-box models that are separately responsible for fluency, the control attribute, and faithfulness to any conditioning context. We use a Metropolis-Hastings sampling scheme to sample from this energy-based model using bidirectional context and global attribute features.

Existing methods for data-to-text generation show promising results in tackling two major challenges: content planning and surface realization, which transform structured data into fluent text. However, they lack an iterative refinement process for generating text, which can enable the model to perfect the text step-by-step while accepting control over the process. In this paper, we explore enhancing data-to-text generation with an iterative refinement process via diffusion. We have four main contributions: (1) we use the diffusion model to improve the prefix tuning for data-to-text generation; (2) we propose a look-ahead guiding loss to supervise the iterative refinement process for better text generation; (3) we extract content plans from reference text and propose a planning-then-writing pipeline to give the model content planning ability; and (4) we conducted experiments on three data-to-text generation datasets and both automatic evaluation criteria (BLEU, NIST, METEOR, ROUGE(L), CIDEr, TER, MoverScore, BLEURT, and BERTScore) and human evaluation criteria (Quality and Naturalness) show the effectiveness of our model.

Some noninvasive brain-computer interface (BCI) systems are currently available for locked-in syndrome (LIS) but none have incorporated a statistical language model during text generation. Objective. To begin to address the communication needs of individuals with LIS using a noninvasive BCI that involves rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) of symbols and a unique classifier with electroencephalography (EEG) and language model fusion. Methods. The RSVP Keyboard was developed with several unique features. Individual letters are presented at 2.5 per second. Computer classification of letters as targets or nontargets based on EEG is performed using machine learning that incorporates a language model for letter prediction via Bayesian fusion enabling targets to be presented only 1 to 4 times. Nine participants with LIS and 9 healthy controls were enrolled. After screening, subjects first calibrated the system, and then completed a series of balanced word generation mastery tasks that were designed with 5 incremental levels of difficulty, which increased by selecting phrases for which the utility of the language model decreased naturally. Results. Six participants with LIS and 9 controls completed the experiment. All LIS participants successfully mastered spelling at level 1 and one subject achieved level 5. Six of 9 control participants achieved level 5. Conclusions. Individuals who have incomplete LIS may benefit from an EEG-based BCI system, which relies on EEG classification and a statistical language model.

The existing text steganography schemes cannot solve these problems well. This paper proposes a multichannel generative text steganography scheme in the context of social network, which hides secret message into multiple semantically natural texts, even if only a part of which can reconstruct secret message. Combined with the characteristics of social network, the bag-of-words models are used to control the topics of the stego texts in the process of text generation by language model.

One common characteristic of most of the tasks is that the texts are not restricted to some rigid formats when generating. However, we may confront some special text paradigms such as Lyrics (assume the music score is given), Sonnet, SongCi (classical Chinese poetry of the Song dynasty), etc. The typical characteristics of these texts are in three folds: (1) They must comply fully with the rigid predefined formats. (2) They must obey some rhyming schemes. (3) Although they are restricted to some formats, the sentence integrity must be guaranteed. To the best of our knowledge, text generation based on the predefined rigid formats has not been well investigated. Therefore, we propose a simple and elegant framework named SongNet to tackle this problem. The backbone of the framework is a Transformer-based auto-regressive language model. Sets of symbols are tailor-designed to improve the modeling performance especially on format, rhyme, and sentence integrity. We improve the attention mechanism to impel the model to capture some future information on the format. A pre-training and fine-tuning framework is designed to further improve the generation quality.

We hypothesize that the information needed to steer the model to generate a target sentence is already encoded within the model. Accordingly, we explore a different approach altogether: extracting latent vectors directly from pretrained language model decoders without fine-tuning. Experiments show that there exist steering vectors, which, when added to the hidden states of the language model, generate a target sentence nearly perfectly (> 99 BLEU) for English sentences from a variety of domains. We show that vector arithmetic can be used for unsupervised sentiment transfer on the Yelp sentiment benchmark, with performance comparable to models tailored to this task. We find that distances between steering vectors reflect sentence similarity when evaluated on a textual similarity benchmark (STS-B), outperforming pooled hidden states of models. Finally, we present an analysis of the intrinsic properties of the steering vectors.

RoBERTa-RL is based on the pre-trained language model RoBERTa and is optimized through transfer learning and reinforcement learning. Transfer learning is used to address the issue of scarce data in the ATC domain, while reinforcement learning algorithms are employed to optimize the RoBERTa model and overcome the limitations in model generalization caused by transfer learning. We selected a real-world area control dataset as the target task training and testing dataset, and a tower control dataset generated based on civil aviation radio land-air communication rules as the test dataset for evaluating model generalization. In terms of the ROUGE evaluation metrics, RoBERTa-RL achieved significant results on the area control dataset with ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L scores of 0.9962, 0.992, and 0.996, respectively.

To overcome the limitations of ROUGE in this field, we conducted a detailed evaluation of the proposed model architecture using keyword-based evaluation criteria for the generated repetition instructions. This evaluation criterion calculates various keyword-based metrics based on the segmented results of the repetition instruction text. In the keyword-based evaluation criteria, the constructed model achieved an overall accuracy of 98.8% on the area control dataset and 81.8% on the tower control dataset.

In order to reduce the influence of the candidate pool on the statistical imperceptibility of steganography, we propose a steganography method based on a new sampling strategy. Instead of just consisting of words with high probability, we select words with relatively small difference from the actual sample of the language model to build a candidate pool, thus keeping consistency with the probability distribution of the language model. What's more, we encode the candidate words according to their probability similarity with the target word, which can further maintain the probability distribution.

However, once these honeypots are deployed, they are rarely updated, making them obsolete and easier to fingerprint as time passes. Furthermore, using fully functional computing and networking devices as honeypots presents the risk of an attacker breaking out from the controlled environment. Large-scale text-generating models, commonly referred to as Large Language Models (LLMs), have seen wide implementation using generative-pretrained transformer (GPT) models. These models have seen an explosion in popularity and have been tuned for various use cases. This paper investigates the use of these models to simulate honeypots that are adaptive to threat engagement without the risk of unintended breakouts. This investigation finds that the method these models use to generate output has limitations that can reveal the deception to a dedicated attacker in extended sessions. To overcome this challenge, this paper presents a method to manage the inputs and outputs to reduce non-deterministic output and token usage of a model generating text in a way that simulates a terminal. An example honeypot is evaluated against a traditional low-risk honeypot, Cowrie, where greater similarity to an actual machine for single commands is achieved. Furthermore, in several multi-step attack scenarios, the proposed architecture reduced the token usage by up to 77% when compared to a baseline scenario that did not manage the inputs to and outputs from an example model.

We demonstrate continued benefits of scaling by achieving state-of-the-art few-shot learning results on hundreds of language understanding and generation benchmarks. On a number of these tasks, PaLM 540B achieves breakthrough performance, outperforming the finetuned state-of-the-art on a suite of multi-step reasoning tasks, and outperforming average human performance on the recently released BIG-bench benchmark. A significant number of BIG-bench tasks showed discontinuous improvements from model scale, meaning that performance steeply increased as we scaled to our largest model. PaLM also has strong capabilities in multilingual tasks and source code generation, which we demonstrate on a wide array of benchmarks.

"Prabhakaran, Vinodkumar; Hutchinson, Ben; Mitchell, Margaret",,,Perturbation Sensitivity Analysis to Detect Unintended Model Biases,,, ,Proceedings Paper ,2019,"Data-driven statistical Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques leverage large amounts of language data to build models that can understand language. However, most language data reflect the public discourse at the time the data was produced, and hence NLP models are susceptible to learning incidental associations around named referents at a particular point in time, in addition to general linguistic meaning. An NLP system designed to model notions such as sentiment and toxicity should ideally produce scores that are independent of the identity of such entities mentioned in text and their social associations. For example, in a general purpose sentiment analysis system, a phrase such as I hate Katy Perry should be interpreted as having the same sentiment as I hate Taylor Swift. Based on this idea, we propose a generic evaluation framework, Perturbation Sensitivity Analysis, which detects unintended model biases related to named entities, and requires no new annotations or corpora. We demonstrate the utility of this analysis by employing it on two different NLP models - a sentiment model and a toxicity model - applied on online comments in English language from four different genres.",,,978-1-950737-90-1,5740-5745, , Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing / 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (EMNLP-IJCNLP)Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing / 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (EMNLP-IJCNLP) ,

As largemodels require millions of training examples to achieve good performance, it is difficult to completely prevent them from being exposed to such content. In this paper, we first demonstrate a surprising finding: Pretrained language models recognize, to a considerable degree, their undesirable biases and the toxicity of the content they produce. We refer to this capability as self-diagnosis. Based on this finding, we then propose a decoding algorithm that, given only a textual description of the undesired behavior, reduces the probability of a language model producing problematic text. We refer to this approach as self-debiasing. Self-debiasing does not rely on manually curated-word lists, nor does it require any training data or changes to the model's parameters.

In cases where there is insufficient labeled molecule data, an effective approach is to pre-train GNNs on large-scale unlabeled molecular data and then fine-tune them for downstream tasks. Among pre-training strategies, node-level pre-training involves masking and predicting atom properties, while motif-based methods capture rich information in subgraphs. These approaches have shown effectiveness across various downstream tasks. However, current pre-training frameworks face two main challenges: (1) node-level auxiliary tasks do not preserve useful domain knowledge, and (2) the fusion of motif-based methods and node-level tasks is computationally extensive. To address these challenges, we propose Descriptor-based Graph Self-supervised Learning (DGSSL), a method that utilizes domain knowledge to enhance graph representation learning. We extract domain knowledge from a descriptor language known as fragmentary code of substructure superposition (FCSS), where molecules are described using substructures that can serve as centers for weak bonds. Specifically, DGSLL identifies descriptor centers in molecules and encodes motif-like information as special atomic numbers in the pre-training tasks. This enables node-level self-supervised pre-training frameworks for GNNs to also capture rich information in local subgraphs. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three toxicity-related benchmarks and show their significance in an ablation experiment.",2169-3536,,,91842-91849, ,  ,

To ensure treatment safety, research efforts are needed to comprehensively detect and understand irAEs. Retrospective analysis of data from electronic health records can provide knowledge to characterize these toxicities. However, such information is not captured in a structured format within the electronic health record and requires manual chart review.MATERIALS AND METHODS In this work, we propose a natural language processing pipeline that can automatically annotate clinical notes and determine whether there is evidence that a patient developed an irAE. Seven hundred eighty-one cases were manually reviewed by clinicians and annotated for irAEs at the patient level. A dictionary of irAEs keywords was used to perform text reduction on clinical notes belonging to each patient; only sentences with relevant expressions were kept. Word embeddings were then used to generate vector representations over the reduced text, which served as input for the machine learning classifiers. The output of the models was presence or absence of any irAEs. Additional models were built to classify skin-related toxicities, endocrine toxicities, and colitis. D RESULTS The model for any irAE achieved an average F1-score = 0.75 and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.85. This outperformed a basic keyword filtering approach. Although the classifier of any irAEs achieved good accuracy, individual irAE classification still has room for improvement.CONCLUSION We demonstrate that patient-level annotations combined with a machine learning approach using keywords filtering and word embeddings can achieve promising accuracy in classifying irAEs in clinical notes. This model may facilitate annotation and analysis of large irAEs data sets. (C) 2021 by American Society of Clinical Oncology",2473-4276,,,541-549, ,  ,

In this paper, we study the relationship between structure and toxicity in conversations on Twitter. We collect 1.18M conversations (58.5M tweets, 4.4M users) prompted by tweets that are posted by or mention major news outlets over one year and candidates who ran in the 2018 US midterm elections over four months. We analyze the conversations at the individual, dyad, and group level. At the individual level, we find that toxicity is spread across many low to moderately toxic users. At the dyad level, we observe that toxic replies are more likely to come from users who do not have any social connection nor share many common friends with the poster. At the group level, we find that toxic conversations tend to have larger, wider, and deeper reply trees, but sparser follow graphs. To test the predictive power of the conversational structure, we consider two prediction tasks. In the first prediction task, we demonstrate that the structural features can be used to predict whether the conversation will become toxic as early as the first ten replies. In the second prediction task, we show that the structural characteristics of the conversation are also predictive of whether the next reply posted by a specific user will be toxic or not. We observe that the structural and linguistic characteristics of the conversations are complementary in both prediction tasks. Our findings inform the design of healthier social media platforms and demonstrate that models based on the structural characteristics of conversations can be used to detect early signs of toxicity and potentially steer conversations in a less toxic direction.",,,978-1-4503-8312-7,1086-1097, , 30th World Wide Web Conference (WWW)30th World Wide Web Conference (WWW) ,

Interestingly, users loyal to reliable sources use on average a more toxic language than their counterpart.

In the context Of understanding the genetic basis of nicotine dependence, we integrate gene and pathway information and show how three complex biological queries can be answered by the integrated knowledge base.Methods: We use an ontology-driven approach to integrate two gene resources (Entrez Gene and Homolo-Gene) and three pathway resources (KEGG, Reactome and BioCyc), for five organisms, including humans. We created the Entrez Knowledge Model (EKoM), an information model in OWL for the gene resources, and integrated it with the extant BioPAX ontology designed for pathway resources. The integrated schema is populated with data from the pathway resources, Publicly available in BioPAX-compatible format, and gene resources for which a Population procedure was created. The SPARQL query language is used to formulate queries over the integrated knowledge base to answer the three biological queries. Results: Simple SPARQL queries could easily identify hub genes, i.e., those genes whose gene products participate in many pathways or interact with many other gene products. The identification of the genes expressed in the brain turned out to be more difficult, due to the lack of a common identification scheme for Proteins.Conclusion: Semantic Web technologies provide a valid framework for information integration in the life sciences. Ontology-driven integration represents a flexible, Sustainable and extensible solution to the integration of large volumes of information.

We focused on concentrations of aluminum (Al), arsenic (As), copper (Cu), chromium (Cr), mercury (Hg), lead (Pb), selenium (Se) and zinc (Zn), as these contaminants arc potentially associated with those sources and are known to pose a risk for terrestrial vertebrates. Stable isotope values of nitrogen (delta N-15:N- 15/N-14), carbon (delta C-13: C-13/C-12) and sulphur (delta S-34:S- 34/S-32) were used as dietary proxies to control for potential effects of prey composition on the contamination pattern. The spatial distribution of potential contamination sources was quantified using geographic information systems. Concentrations of Hg in the southern part of the study area were above a reported toxicity threshold for raptors, particularly in territories closer to a coal-fired power plant at Sines, showing that contamination persisted after a previous assessment conducted in the 1990s. Hg and Se levels were positively correlated with delta N-15, which indicates biomagnification. Concentrations of As, Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn were generally low and unrelated to mining- or industrial activities, indicating low environmental background concentrations. Al was found at higher concentrations in the southernmost areas of Portugal, but this pattern might be related to external soil contamination on feathers. Overall, this study indicates that. among all elements studied, Hg seems to be the most important contaminant for Bonelli's eagles in southern Portugal, likely due to the power plant emissions and biomagnitication of Hg in terrestrial food webs.

Their value may vary according to the location and emission season; that is, they are site and temporal dependent. In this study, phosphorus fate factors for the freshwater eutrophication impact category were estimated in a native scale of state hydrographic units (SHU), considering its variability and applied in a case study for one hydrographic basin in the state of Bahia, Brazil. Methods The fate model considered the phosphorus removal processes of advection, retention, and agricultural and domestic water use, based on national databases (Geonetwork, HidroWeb, SAR, and SNIS). Heat maps and correlation networks allowed the assessment of fate factors' spatiotemporal variability. The new generated fate factors were qualitatively and quantitatively assessed, then further applied in a case study of buffalo milk production at Leste SHU to determine the regionalization effects on the freshwater eutrophication potential impact. Results and discussion This study reconfirmed the spatial and temporal variability of the fate factors. The fate factor values found, in this study, for Pardo SHU are similar to those estimated with the non-regionalized data used by the adopted model, being within the range of 0 to 20 days. However, the fate factors for De Contas and, mainly, for Leste were underestimated, reaching a value up to five times higher, indicating that the model's proposed changes impacted the final result. The temporal differentiation was mainly determined by periods of higher and lower water availability. Advection processes inversely determined the fate factors, and the phosphorus removal by retention processes became more prominent when the water availability was lower. On the other hand, the role of phosphorus removal through water use was minimum. Water availability was the largest contributor to the sensitivity analysis, followed by the total freshwater volume. Conclusion The fate modeling adopted in this study, with the use of data from national databases and native resolution, gave a more precise and detailed analysis perspective of the phosphorus fate in Brazilian SHUs, setting up site- and temporal-specific fate factors. Besides, this study provides a further understanding of the fate factors establishment by analyzing their relationship with the respective input parameters and highlighting one of the used model's weaknesses: the estimation of phosphorus removals instead of phosphorus load underestimates the true freshwater eutrophication potential.",0948-3349,1614-7502,,879-898, ,  ,

There is a competition between wet and thermal routes for phosphate fertilizers manufacture. In the Brazilian case, the thermal route is represented by thermophosphate. This fertilizer is considered the most adequate one for Brazilian agricultural conditions; its main restriction is the intensive consumption of energy necessary for its production. The wet route uses sulfuric acid to directly produce the single superphosphate (SSP) or the intermediate phosphoric acid, which will be used to result in triple superphosphate (TSP) and ammonium phosphate production. The main restriction of the wet route is the large amount of phosphogypsum generated in phosphoric acid production. Envisaged is an environmental comparison of both routes using LCA methodology. This paper presents the LCA for SSP production. The goal of the study is to establish the Environmental Profile of this fertilizer. Eight impact categories were selected for the study.

The SSP system (single superphosphate) comprises the stages of mining and concentration of the phosphate rock, elemental sulfur extraction, production of sulfuric acid, and manufacture of single superphosphate.SSP LCI. The LCI was performed considering the production of 1.0 ton of SSP (single superphosphate) as a Functional Unit. The data collected were developed for different producing companies, all of them located in the same regional area. Allocation criteria of energy and mass were applied to the production of sulfuric acid and manufacture of single superphosphate. The transportation step included either the transport of the mined phosphated rock to the concentration plant or the transport of the phosphate concentrate to the SSP unit.Conclusion, Recommendation and Perspective. The accomplishment of an LCA to SSP production identified the GWP and EP as its meaningful environmental impacts. In reference to global warming, the transportation step was the greatest contributor agent, while the losses of PO4- from the SSP manufacturing were the main cause of ER The most important contribution in terms of water consumption was observed in the concentration step. Finally, the self sufficiency of the sulfuric acid production in energetic terms must be highlighted.The knowledge of the environmental profile of fertilizers is necessary to support LCA studies of agricultural products, a relevant raw material source for many industrial sectors. The method used here may be important for modelling other LCA fertilizer studies. As most of the agricultural raw materials are transferred among different countries, comparisons of the environmental profiles of fertilizers in developed and developing countries are needed.",0948-3349,1614-7502,,209-214, ,  ,

This extensive production of sugarcane has changed the use and form of Brazilian soil, causing changes in the structural characteristics of humic substances (HS). In this context, the main objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of seasonality on a conditional stability constant (Kc) of the complexes HS-Cu (II) and HS-Cr (III) from the HS of urban and agricultural regions, with an emphasis on sugarcane culture.The study was conducted in the northwestern region of the state of So Paulo, which is the leading producer of sugar and ethanol in the country and is the region with the lowest percentage of riparian vegetation (3 %). Sediments were sampled during the rainy and dry seasons at four locations: (1) a typical agricultural area, (2) an urban area, (3) a sugarcane cultivation area, (4) and an area that receives the entire pollutant load from the hydrographic basin. The HS were extracted and characterized using conventional techniques. The Kc of the HS with copper (Cu) and chromium (Cr) ions was determined by fluorescence suppression employing the Stern-Volmer model.Kc values were higher in the rainy seasons for HS-Cu (II) and HS-Cr (III). The highest value of Kc for the HS with Cu (1.23) and Cr (5.2 x 10(-1)) ions was found during the rainy season in the area receiving the pollutant load from the basin and in the typical area of sugarcane cultivation, respectively. All of the FTIR spectra showed characteristic bands of HS, and the values of the E-4/E-6 ratio confirmed the presence of more aromatic groups. An elemental analysis and molecular fluorescence spectra in the emission mode confirmed that the HS from the agricultural area and sugarcane culture area mostly exhibited characteristics of humic acids and that the HS from the urban area and the area receiving the pollutant load from the basin had a mixture of humic and fulvic acids.We can conclude that HS-metal complexes from the area that received the entire load of pollutants from the watershed and the typical area of sugarcane culture showed the highest stability among the study areas. The Kc values found in the basin were lower than those previously obtained by several studies that were performed in other locations. The HS obtained in rainy season had more aromatic groups in the HS structure, and the HS from the sugarcane area presented more characteristics of humic acids.",1439-0108,1614-7480,,385-393, ,  ,

Any kind of online message can reach anyone in the world almost instantly. The speed with which information spreads is undoubtedly the strength of social networks, but at the same time, any user of these platforms can see how toxic messages spread in parallel with likes, comments and ratings about any person or entity. In such cases, the victim feels even more helpless and defenceless as a result of the rapid spread. For this reason, we have implemented an automatic detector of toxic messages on social media. This allows us to stop toxicity in its tracks and protect victims. In particular, the aim of the survey is to demonstrate how traditional Machine Learning methods of Natural Language Processing (NLP) work on equal terms with Deep Learning methods represented by a Transformer architecture and characterised by a higher computational cost. In particular, the paper describes the results obtained by testing different supervised Machine Learning classifiers (Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine) combined with two topic-modelling techniques of NLP, (Latent Semantic Analysis and Latent Dirichlet Allocation). A pre-trained Transformer named BERTweet was also tested. All models performed well in this task, so much so that values close to or above 90% were achieved in terms of the F1 score evaluation metric.

In this paper we explore whether it is possible to learn disentangled representations by identifying existing subnetworks within pretrained models that encode distinct, complementary aspects. Concretely, we learn binary masks over transformer weights or hidden units to uncover subsets of features that correlate with a specific factor of variation; this eliminates the need to train a disentangled model from scratch for a particular task. We evaluate this method with respect to its ability to disentangle representations of sentiment from genre in movie reviews, toxicity from dialect in Tweets, and syntax from semantics. By combining masking with magnitude pruning we find that we can identify sparse subnetworks within BERT that strongly encode particular aspects (e.g., semantics) while only weakly encoding others (e.g., syntax). Moreover, despite only learning masks, disentanglement-via-masking performs as well as - and often better than - previously proposed methods based on variational autoencoders and adversarial training.",,,978-1-955917-09-4,778-791, , Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP)Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP) ,

Real-world evidence holds potential to improve our understanding of toxicities, but toxicity information is often only in clinical notes. We developed natural language processing (NLP) models to identify the presence and severity of esophagitis from notes of patients treated with thoracic RT.METHODS: Our corpus consisted of a gold-labeled data set of 1,524 clinical notes from 124 patients with lung cancer treated with RT, manually annotated for Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0 esophagitis grade, and a silver-labeled data set of 2,420 notes from 1,832 patients from whom toxicity grades had been collected as structured data during clinical care. We fine-tuned statistical and pretrained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers-based models for three esophagitis classification tasks: task 1, no esophagitis versus grade 1-3; task 2, grade ≤1 versus >1; and task 3, no esophagitis versus grade 1 versus grade 2-3. Transferability was tested on 345 notes from patients with esophageal cancer undergoing RT.RESULTS: Fine-tuning of PubMedBERT yielded the best performance. The best macro-F1 was 0.92, 0.82, and 0.74 for tasks 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Selecting the most informative note sections during fine-tuning improved macro-F1 by ≥2% for all tasks. Silver-labeled data improved the macro-F1 by ≥3% across all tasks. For the esophageal cancer notes, the best macro-F1 was 0.73, 0.74, and 0.65 for tasks 1, 2, and 3, respectively, without additional fine-tuning.CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first effort to automatically extract esophagitis toxicity severity according to CTCAE guidelines from clinical notes.

Studies have shown that irradiation at ultra-high dose rates (FLASH) reduces the severity of toxicities in normal tissues compared to irradiation at conventional dose rates (CONV), as currently used in clinical practice. Most pre-clinical work is currently carried out using charged particle beams and the beam charge monitor described here is relevant to such beams. Any biological effect comparisons between FLASH and CONV irradiations rely on measurement of tissue dose. While well-established approaches can be used to monitor, in real time, the dose delivered during CONV irradiations, monitoring FLASH doses is not so straightforward. Recently the use of non-intercepting beam current transformers (BCTs) has been proposed for FLASH work. Such BCTs have been used for decades in numerous accelerator installations to monitor temporal and intensity beam profiles. In order to serve as monitoring dosimeters, the BCT output current must be integrated, using electronic circuitry or using software integration following signal digitisation. While sensitive enough for FLASH irradiation, where few intense pulses deliver the requisite dose, the inherent insensitivity of BCTs and the need for a wide detection bandwidth makes them less suitable for use during CONV reference irradiations. The purpose of this article is to remind the FLASH community of a different mode of BCT operation: direct monitoring of charge, rather than current, achieved by loading the BCT capacitively rather than resistively. The resulting resonant operation achieves very high sensitivities, enabling straightforward monitoring of output during both CONV and FLASH regimes. Historically, such inductive charge monitors have been used for single pulse work; however, a straightforward circuit modification allows selective resonance damping when repetitive pulsing is used, as during FLASH and CONV irradiations. Practical means of achieving this are presented, as are construction and signal processing details. Finally, results are presented showing the beneficial behaviour of the BCT versus an (Advanced Markus) ionisation chamber for measurements over a dose rate range, from <0.1 Gys(-1) to >3 kGys(-1).",2296-424X,,,, ,  ,

Electric components such as motors and transformers are mostly based on electromagnetic transduction at present. With reducing their size, these electromagnetic components reduce their efficiency drastically due to the Joule heat in their thin coil wire (i.e., the resistance in the coil becomes significant). Thus, piezoelectric actuators and transducers with much less losses are highly sought after in the 21 century. In the past 30 years, most researchers have put efforts on improving the piezoelectric performance from the real-part property's viewpoint: that is, improved displacement, force, responsivity etc. However, from the viewpoint of efficiency and reliability such as heat generation or performance degradation under high voltage/power drive, the key is the imaginary-part; that is, loss and hysteresis mechanisms.Piezoelectric devices seem to be all-around contributors and a key component to the above mentioned four R&D areas in the sustainable society. Some of the efforts include: (a) Since the most widely used piezoelectric lead zirconate titante (PZT) ceramics will be regulated in less than 10 years in European and Japanese communities due to their toxicity (Pb(2+) ion), lead-free piezoelectric ceramics based on (K,Na)(Ta,Nb)O(3) and (Bi,Na,Ba)TiO(3) have been developed with performance equivalent to the PZTs. (b) Since hazardous organic substances such as dioxin can be easily dissolved by the irradiation of ultrasonic energy in water, a new technology for safe disposal of dioxin using high-power piezoelectric transducers has been developed. (c) We demonstrated an energy recovery system on a hybrid car from its engine's mechanical vibration to the fuel cell for electric charging. A self-powered remote light switching system has also been developed using piezoelectric bimorphs. (d) Micro ultrasonic motors based on piezoelectrics demonstrated 1/20 reduction in the volume and weight and a 20 time increase in efficiency of the conventional electromagnetic motors with equivalent output power. We also demonstrated compact and highly-efficient high-voltage supplies with piezoelectric transformers, which have been widely commercialized for laptop backlight inverter applications.

The mean levels of Sigma(8)-dioxin-like (DL), Sigma(6)-indicator PCBs and WHO2005-TEQ for DL-PCBs were 2.22 +/- 2.55 ng/g, 9.49 +/- 8.04 ng/g and 4.77 +/- 4.89 pg/g, respectively. The multiple linear regression indicated a significant correlation of dusting frequency (p = 1.06 x 10-04) and age of the house (p = 1.02 x 10-06) with PCB concentrations in indoor environment. The spatial variation of PCB profile revealed relatively higher concentrations from sites near to illegal waste burning spots, electrical locomotive workshops, and grid stations. Human health risk assessment of PCBs for adults and toddlers through all three exposure routes (ie, inhalation, ingestion, and dermal contact) demonstrated that toddlers were vulnerable to high cancer risk (4.32 x 10(-04)), while adults were susceptible from low to moderate levels of risk (3.16 x 10(-05)). Therefore, comprehensive investigations for PCBs in the indoor settings, focusing particularly on the sensitive populations with relationship to the electronic devices, transformers, and illegal waste burning sites, are recommended.",0905-6947,1600-0668,,1417-1426, ,  ,

To date, carbon quantum dots (C-QDs) have attracted a lot of attention due to their size/shape/composition tunable optical properties, high quantum yield, excellent photostability, lower toxicity and simple synthetic methods using earth-abundant and low-cost precursors. However, due to the overlap between their absorption and emission spectra, it is still challenging to fabricate high-efficiency LSCs based on C-dots. In this work, we used C-QDs to fabricate semi-transparent large-area laminated LSCs (10 x 10 cm(2)). C-QDs have the absorption spectrum ranging from 300 to 550 nm with a Stokes shift of 0.6 eV. By optimizing the concentration of C-QDs, the laminated LSC exhibits a highest eta(opt) of 1.6%, which is 1.6 times higher than that of a single-layer LSC (100 mW cm(-2)). In addition, the laminated LSC exhibits a power conversion efficiency of 0.7% under natural sunlight illumination (62 mW cm(-2)) with excellent photostability. These findings suggest that laminated structured LSCs could be used for efficient solar energy harvesting compared to single layer or tandem structured LSCs based on colloidal C-QDs.",2516-0230,,,4888-4894, ,  ,

In the present study, we studied the transformation of C-14- labeled TBBPA by a polychlorinated-biphenyl-degrading bacterium, Rhodococcus jostii RHAl (RHA1), under oxic conditions. During the 5-day incubation, TBBPA was biotransformed rapidly first to its monomethyl ether MeO-TBBPA and then to its more hydrophobic but less toxic dimethyl ether diMeO-TBBPA. The biotransformation followed pseudo-first-order decay kinetics, with a half-life of TBBPA of 0.32 days and only 0.6% of the initially added amount being mineralized. Considering the frequent co-occurrence of TBBPA with heavy metals in the natural environment, we also investigated the effects of three heavy metals (Cd, Cu, and Fe) on the transformation of TBBPA by strain RHA1. While TBBPA transformation was not significantly altered by Cd, it was accelerated by Cu and Fe, presumably due to the effects of these two essential metals on O-methyltransferase activity. Overall, the present study showed that RHAl is an effective transformer of TBBPA and that certain essential metals, including Cu and Fe, promote the transformation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

This study uses Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to compare the environmental impacts of a diesel/PV/wind hybrid microgrid on the island of Koh Jig, Thailand with the electrification alternatives of grid extension and home diesel generators. The impact categories evaluated are: acidification potential (kg SO2 eq), global warming potential (kg CO2 eq), human toxicity potential (kg 1.4 DCB eq), and abiotic resource depletion potential (kg Sb eq). The results show that the microgrid system has the lowest global warming and abiotic resource depletion potentials of all three electrification scenarios. The use phase of the diesel generator and the extraction of copper are shown to significantly contribute to the microgrid's environmental impacts. The relative environmental impacts of the grid extension scenario are found to be proportional to the distance required for grid extension. Across all categories except acidification potential, the impacts from the home diesel generators are the largest. Sensitivity analyses show that maximizing the renewable energy fraction does not necessarily produce a more environmentally sustainable electrification scenario and that the diesel generator provides versatility to the system by allowing power production to be scaled significantly before more technology is needed to meet demand. While the environmental benefits of the microgrid increase as the installation community becomes more isolated, the choice of electrification scenario requires assigning relative importance to each impact category and considering social and economic factors.

However, females are inefficient agents in SIT programs. Here we report a conditional female-killing (FK) strategy based on the tetracycline-off system. We assembled sixteen genetic constructs for testing in vitro and in vivo. Twenty-four independent transgenic strains of D. suzukii were generated and tested for female-specific lethality. The strongest FK effect in the absence of tetracycline was achieved by the construct containing D. suzukii nullo promoter for early gene expression, D. suzukii pro-apoptotic gene hid(Ala4) for lethality, and the transformer gene intron from the Mediterranean fruit fly Ceratitis capitata for female-specific splicing. One strain carrying this construct eliminated 100% of the female offspring during embryogenesis and produced only males.

Choosing epitope regions experimentally for the production of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine can be time-consuming, costly, and labor-intensive. Scientists have created in silico prediction techniques based on machine learning to find these regions, to cut down the number of candidate epitopes that might be tested in experiments, and, as a result, to lessen the time-consuming process of their mapping. However, the tools and approaches involved continue to have low accuracy. In this work, we propose a hybrid deep learning model based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) for the classification of peptides into epitopes or non-epitopes. Numerous transfer learning strategies were utilized, and the fine-tuned method gave the best result, with an AUC of 0.979, an f1 score of 0.902, and 95.1% accuracy, which was far better than the performance of the model trained from scratch.

In North and Central America it was eradicated using the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT). A control program is managed cooperatively between the governments of the United States and Panama to prevent the northward spread of NWS from infested countries in South America. This is accomplished by maintaining a permanent barrier through the release of millions of sterile male and female flies in the border between Panama and Colombia. Our research team demonstrated the utility of biotechnology-enhanced approaches for SIT by developing a male-only strain of the NWS. The strain carried a single component tetracycline repressible female lethal system where females died at late larval/pupal stages. The control program can be further improved by removing females during embryonic development as larval diet costs are significant.ResultsThe strains developed carry a two-component system consisting of the Lucilia sericata bottleneck gene promoter driving expression of the tTA gene and a tTA-regulated Lshid proapoptotic effector gene. Insertion of the sex-specifically spliced intron from the C. hominivorax transformer gene within the Lshid gene ensures that only females die when insects are reared in the absence of tetracycline. In several double homozygous two-component strains and in one All-in-one strain that had both components in a single construct, female lethality occurred at the embryonic and/or first instar larval stages when raised on diet without tetracycline. Laboratory evaluation for phenotypes that are relevant for mass rearing in a production facility revealed that most strains had fitness characteristics similar to the wild type J06 strain that is currently reared for release in the permanent barrier. Testing of an All in one strain under mass rearing conditions showed that the strain maintained the fitness characteristics observed in small-scale rearing.ConclusionsThe early female lethal strains described here could be selected by the NWS Control Program for testing at large scale in the production facility to enhance the efficiency of the NWS eradication program.",1471-2156,,,, ,  ,

The kinetics of maize (Zea mays L.) leaf elongation were measured with Linear Variable Differential Transformers (LVDTs). After exposure to salinity (0 to 120 mol m-3 NaCl), leaf elongation rates (LER) declined rapidly. Within 4 h, LER had recovered and reached a new steady-state for all salinity treatments. These rates were reduced by 10, 20, and 60% of control rates by 40, 80 and 120 mol m-3 NaCl, respectively. Osmotic adjustment in the growing zone of leaves was correlated with the recovery of LER after plant exposure to salinity. However, after 4 h of exposure, the osmolality of the cell sap continued to increase without effect on steady-state LER. Estimates of the apparent turgor in the growing zone indicated that turgor was no longer limiting LER of salt-stressed plants after 4 h. An in vivo technique was developed to apply a unidirectional force to intact growing leaves of maize to mimic increases in elongation force. Relative elongation rate (RER) were increased by adding weights to the LVDT core to increase elongation force. Plots of RER as a function of elongation force gave estimates of two growth coefficients: the yield threshold and the yielding coefficient, mL/(m + L), where m is the cell wall extensibility and L is the hydraulic conductivity. RER as a function of elongation force was determined immediately, 0.5, 4, and 21 h after plants were salinized. Estimates of the growth coefficients indicated that the apparent yield threshold decreased immediately after salinization. However, when LER reached steady-state, the yield threshold of salt-stressed plants had increased above control values and was the only limiting growth coefficient. There were no significant effects of salinity on the yielding coefficients, cell wall extensibility or hydraulic conductivity. One of the advantages of this in vivo technique over other methods is that yield threshold, yielding coefficient, and cell wall extensibility can be determined without the confounding effects of wounding or osmotic stress. This technique may prove widely applicable to the study of other growth regulating factors.",0022-0957,,,1417-1426, ,  ,

The key problem is to inject huge power to the grid, generating from renewable energy sources with traditional electrical equipment and grid infrastructure. Currently, work on DC networks is achieving great attention in distributed power generation system, which arise the problem related to the significance of DC power flow control in DC networks. Interline power flow controller (IPFC) are used to control of power flow in the multi-lines and parallel transmission lines. In this paper, a new topology for Interline DC Power Flow Controller (IDCPFC) based on the Zero Sequence Blocking Transformer (ZSBT) has been proposed and analyzed. In the proposed model, the buck converter works as a variable transformer and its current is regulated through the duty cycle of converter. In Comparison with pervious topologies the control algorithm is simple. To validate the topology, simulation results of proposed topology are investigated in this paper. Large-scale network has the characteristics of complex system, and its survivability is different from simple network. The current network survivability studies usually only aim for a specific network level or type, and seldom investigate survivability from a system perspective. In this paper, the concept of large-scale network survivability is defined from the perspective of complex system, the survivability association is analyzed based upon the correlation characteristics of complex system, and the structural model of large-scale network survivability association is established and its properties are analyzed. On the basis of survivability association properties, the survivability association function is defined based upon set pair analysis theory, which is utilized to characterize the survivability association degree among subsystems in large-scale network.

Mushroom poisoning is one of the most serious food safety issues worldwide. Motivated by this problem, this study uses an open-source mushroom dataset and employs several data augmentation approaches to decrease the probability of model overfitting. We propose a novel deep learning pipeline (ViT-Mushroom) for mushroom classification using the Vision Transformer large network (ViT-L/32). We compared the performance of our method against that of a convolutional neural network (CNN).

The results show that ViT-L/32 is the best on the testing dataset, with an accuracy score of 95.97%. These results surpass previous approaches in reducing intraclass variability and generating well-separated feature embeddings. The proposed method is a promising deep learning model capable of automatically classifying mushroom species, helping wild mushroom consumers avoid eating toxic mushrooms, safeguarding food safety, and preventing public health incidents of food poisoning.

In addition to producing explicitly offensive utterances, these models can also implicitly insult a group or individual by aligning themselves with an offensive statement. To better understand the dynamics of contextually offensive language, we investigate the stance of dialogue model responses in offensive Reddit conversations. Specifically, we create TOXICHAT, a crowd-annotated dataset of 2,000 Reddit threads and model responses labeled with offensive language and stance. Our analysis reveals that 42% of human responses agree with toxic comments, whereas only 13% agree with safe comments. This undesirable behavior is learned by neural dialogue models, such as DialoGPT, which we show are two times more likely to agree with offensive comments. To enable automatic detection of offensive language, we fine-tuned transformer-based classifiers on TOXICHAT that achieve 0.71 F-1 for offensive labels and 0.53 Macro-F-1 for stance labels. Finally, we quantify the effectiveness of controllable text generation (CTG) methods to mitigate the tendency of neural dialogue models to agree with offensive comments.

Thus, social media has become a perfect place for users' malicious behaviors like committing hate crimes, spreading toxic information, abetting crimes, etc. Malicious behaviors are covert and widespread, with potential relevance regarding topic, person, place, and so on. Therefore, it is necessary to develop novel techniques to detect and disrupt malicious behavior on social media effectively. Previous research has shown promising results in extracting semantic text (speech) representation using natural language processing methods. Yet the latent relation between speeches and the connection between users behind speeches is rarely explored. In light of this, we propose a holistic model named Graph adaption BERT (GraphBERT) to detect malicious behaviors on Twitter with both semantic and relational information. Specifically, we first present a novel and a largescale corpus of tweet data to benefit both graph-based and language-based malicious behavior detection research. Then, we design a novel model GraphBERT to learn comprehensive tweet and user representation with the integration of both semantic information encoded by transformers (i.e., BERT) and relational information encoded by graph neural network. GraphBERT further leverages a weight adaption BERT module implemented between transformer layers to refine tweet embedding using relational information for malicious tweet classification. Finally, the adapted tweet embedding is used with the initial tweet representation to generate user embedding for malicious user detection. The extensive experiments on the collected Twitter data show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods for both tasks (i.e., malicious tweet classification and malicious user detection).",1550-4786,,978-1-6654-5099-7,548-557, , 22nd IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM)22nd IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM) ,

Firstly, it can negatively impact the mental health of individuals who view or are exposed to it, particularly children and vulnerable individuals. Secondly, it can lead to the spread of illegal content such as child pornography or revenge porn, which can cause significant harm to the victims involved. Lastly, it can create a toxic and unsafe online environment, where cyberbullying, harassment, and hate speech thrive, ultimately leading to social division and harm to the community. As a result, it is important to promote the responsible and respectful use of online platforms to prevent such harm. Therefore, it is important to segment such obscene regions present in images across social media platforms. To deal with the issue, we have proposed a modified encoder-decoder-based technique entitled sandglass-block encoder with attention skip and swin-based bottleneck (SAS-UNet) for the segmentation of obscenity in nude/obscene images. Our proposed method SASUNet incorporates the usage of a sandglass block in the encoder section of U-Net, a swin transformer in the bottleneck, and CBAM inclusion at the skip connection. The proposed model is trained and validated with the segmented obscene image (SOI) dataset. The collected obscene images were segmented precisely to build a binary mask of all the obscene images.

This study aims to develop an AI model for the automatic detection of offensive textual content in Pashto. To achieve this goal, we have developed a benchmark dataset called the Pashto Offensive Language Dataset (POLD), which comprises tweets collected from Twitter and manually classified into two categories: offensiveand not offensive. To discriminate these two categories, we investigated the classic deep learning classifiers based on neural networks, including CNNs and RNNs, using static word embeddings: Word2Vec, fastText, and GloVe as features. Furthermore, we examined two transfer learning approaches. In the first approach, we fine-tuned the pre-trained multilingual language model, XLM-R, using the POLD dataset, whereas, in the second approach, we trained a monolingual BERT model for Pashto from scratch using a custom-developed text corpus. Pashto BERT was then fine-tuned similarly to XLM-R. The performance of all the deep learning and transformer learning models was evaluated using the POLD dataset.

The lack of a sufficient amount of labelled hate speech data, along with the existing biases, has been the main issue in this domain of research. To address these needs, in this study we introduce a novel transfer learning approach based on an existing pre-trained language model called BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers).

The computed 'moral direction' can rate the normativity (or non-normativity) of arbitrary phrases without explicitly training the LM for this task, reflecting social norms well.

A plethora of work has been proposed to certify the robustness of feed-forward networks, e.g., FCNs and CNNs. Yet, most existing methods cannot be directly applied to recurrent neural networks (RNNs), due to their sequential inputs and unique operations.In this paper, we present CERT-RNN, a general framework for certifying the robustness of RNNs. Specifically, through detailed analysis for the intrinsic property of the unique function in different ranges, we exhaustively discuss different cases for the exact formula of bounding planes, based on which we design several precise and efficient abstract transformers for the unique calculations in RNNs. CERT-RNN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods (e.g., POPQORN [25]) in terms of (i) effectiveness - it provides much tighter robustness bounds, and (ii) efficiency - it scales to much more complex models. Through extensive evaluation, we validate CERT-RNN's superior performance across various network architectures (e.g., vanilla RNN and LSTM) and applications (e.g., image classification, sentiment analysis, toxic comment detection, and malicious URL detection). For instance, for the RNN-2-32 model on the MNIST sequence dataset, the robustness bound certified by CERT-RNN is on average 1.86 times larger than that by POPQORN. Besides certifying the robustness of given RNNs, CERT-RNN also enables a range of practical applications including evaluating the provable effectiveness for various defenses (i.e., the defense with a larger robustness region is considered to be more robust), improving the robustness of RNNs (i.e., incorporating CERT-RNN with verified robust training) and identifying sensitive words (i.e., the word with the smallest certified robustness bound is considered to be the most sensitive word in a sentence), which helps build more robust and interpretable deep learning systems.

Negative and hateful comments are averting users from sharing their opinion freely on social media platforms. It often breaks people's confidence and causes extensive damage to their mental health. Hence, identifying these toxic contents and taking appropriate measures against them is crucial to preserve a safe environment on social media. Numerous state-of-the-art approaches classify the whole content as toxic or non-toxic, but they don't distinguish the precise toxic portion from the whole content. Detecting the toxic portions is essential as it substantially aids to moderate the toxic contents through excluding the abusive parts. This paper describes our proposed approach to detect the toxic portions from text contents efficiently and accurately. We explore an ensemble of sequence labeling models including the word embedding-based Spark NLP NER (named entity recognition) deep learning model, spaCy NER model with custom toxic tags, and ALBERT NER model to identify the toxic spans. The NER-based models usually intend to capture the contextual attributes of phrases and spans that are essential for named entity recognition. As the toxic span detection task also requires us to apprehend the phrasal context for detecting toxic span, the similarity between these two tasks inspires us to exploit these NER models. Finally, we determine the final toxic spans using a prevalence-based fusion of the predictions generated by these models. The fusion strategy enables us to consolidate the diversity of these models for perceiving the phrasal context in all aspects. Experimental results achieved on the SemEval2021 toxic spans detection dataset depict that our model meticulously captures the toxic fragment and achieves a competitive result among the other state-of-the-art methods.

Existing work to generate such attacks is either based on human-generated attacks which is costly and not scalable or, in case of automatic attacks, the attack vector does not conform to human-like language, which can be detected using a language model loss. In this work, we propose attacks against conversational agents that are imperceptible, i.e., they fit the conversation in terms of coherency, relevancy, and fluency, while they are effective and scalable, i.e., they can automatically trigger the system into generating toxic language.

We explore the feasibility and benefits of upstream bias mitigation (UBM) for reducing bias on downstream tasks, by first applying bias mitigation to an upstream model through fine-tuning and subsequently using it for downstream fine-tuning. We find, in extensive experiments across hate speech detection, toxicity detection, occupation prediction, and coreference resolution tasks over various bias factors, that the effects of UBM are indeed transferable to new downstream tasks or domains via fine-tuning, creating less biased downstream models than directly fine-tuning on the downstream task or transferring from a vanilla upstream model.

Negative transfer is a phenomenon that occurs when noisy information is shared between tasks, resulting in a drop in performance.

This paper addresses the challenge of Roman Urdu toxic comment detection by developing a first-ever large labeled corpus of toxic and non-toxic comments.

Despite the success of the latter in classifying toxic comments in English, the absence of pre-trained word embeddings for Roman Urdu prompted to generate different word embeddings using Glove, Word2Vec and FastText techniques, and compare them with task-specific word embeddings learned inside the classification task.

Many proposed techniques for detecting toxic comments use deep neural networks. Like Siri, a smartwatch can use a remote service to detect toxic comments, or alternatively run the neural network on the edge to detect such comments. This paper presents the results of an experiment comparing the tradeoffs in memory consumption, CPU load and response time between running a toxic text detection CNN on a Samsung S3 smartwatch, or running the CNN remotely using computational offloading. Sentences were processed either periodically or by using a Poisson distribution with periods of between 0.25 and 4 minutes. The results were that there was little difference in battery depletion between running the CNN locally on the watch or remotely running the CNN. However, using WIFI for offloading resulted in much better (< 1 second) response time than running the CNN on the watch (1-2 seconds).

Data augmentation is a frequently used approach to overcome issues related to the lack of data or problems related to imbalanced classes. Such techniques are used to generate artificial data samples used to improve the volume of the training set or to balance the target distribution. In the antisocial behavior detection domain, we frequently face both issues, the lack of quality labeled data as well as class imbalance. As the majority of the data in this domain is textual, we must consider augmentation methods suitable for NLP tasks. Easy data augmentation (EDA) represents a group of such methods utilizing simple text transformations to create the new, artificial samples. Our main motivation is to explore EDA techniques' usability on the selected tasks from the antisocial behavior detection domain. We focus on the class imbalance problem and apply EDA techniques to two problems: fake news and toxic comments classification. In both cases, we train the convolutional neural networks classifier and compare its performance on the original and EDA-extended datasets. EDA techniques prove to be very task-dependent, with certain limitations resulting from the data they are applied on. The model's performance on the extended toxic comments dataset did improve only marginally, gaining only 0.01 improvement in the F1 metric when applying only a subset of EDA methods. EDA techniques in this case were not suitable enough to handle texts written in more informal language. On the other hand, on the fake news dataset, the performance was improved more significantly, boosting the F1 score by 0.1. Improvement was most significant in the prediction of the minor class, where F1 improved from 0.67 to 0.86.",,1999-5903,,, ,  ,

Thus, how a message is perceived becomes equally important regardless of whether the sent message includes any form of explicit attack or offense. This study focuses on identifying the implicit attacks and negative intentions in text-based conversation from the reader's point of view. We focus on questions in conversations and investigate the underlying perceived intention. We introduce our dataset that includes questions, intention polarity, and type of attacks.

This work brings a brief overview of how toxic information looks like, how it is spread, and how to potentially prevent its dissemination by early recognition of disinformation using deep learning. We investigated the overall suitability of deep learning in solving problem of detection of disinformation in conversational content.

Therefore, ethnicitytargeted hate speech detection in user texts is becoming an important task. However, it faces a number of unresolved problems: difficulties of reliable mark-up, informal and indirect ways of expressing negativity in user texts (such as irony, false generalization and attribution of unfavored actions to targeted groups), users' inclination to express opposite attitudes to different ethnic groups in the same text and, finally, lack of research on languages other than English. In this work we address several of these problems in the task of ethnicity-targeted hate speech detection in Russian-language social media texts. This approach allows us to differentiate between attitudes towards different ethnic groups mentioned in the same text - a task that has never been addressed before. We use a dataset of over 2,6M user messages mentioning ethnic groups to construct a representative sample of 12K instances (ethnic group, text) that are further thoroughly annotated via a special procedure. In contrast to many previous collections that usually comprise extreme cases of toxic speech, representativity of our sample secures a realistic and, therefore, much higher proportion of subtle negativity which additionally complicates its automatic detection. We then experiment with four types of machine learning models, from traditional classifiers such as SVM to deep learning approaches, notably the recently introduced BERT architecture, and interpret their predictions in terms of various linguistic phenomena. In addition to hate speech detection with a text-level two-class approach (hate, no hate), we also justify and implement a unique instance-based three-class approach (positive, neutral, negative attitude, the latter implying hate speech). Our best results are achieved by using fine-tuned and pre-trained RuBERT combined with linguistic features, with F1-hate=0.760, F1-macro=0.833 on the textlevel two-class problem comparable to previous studies, and F1-hate=0.813, F1-macro=0.824 on our unique instance-based three-class hate speech detection task.

"Khalid, Osama; Rusert, Jonathan; Srinivasan, Padmini",,,Suum Cuique: Studying Bias in Taboo Detection with a Community Perspective,,, ,Proceedings Paper ,2022,"Prior research has discussed and illustrated the need to consider linguistic norms at the community level when studying taboo (hateful/offensive/toxic etc.) language. However, a methodology for doing so, that is firmly founded on community language norms is still largely absent. This can lead both to biases in taboo text classification and limitations in our understanding of the causes of bias. We propose a method to study bias in taboo classification and annotation where a community perspective is front and center. This is accomplished by using special classifiers tuned for each community's language. In essence, these classifiers represent community level language norms. We use these to study bias and find, for example, biases are largest against African Americans (7/10 datasets and all 3 classifiers examined). In contrast to previous papers we also study other communities and find, for example, strong biases against South Asians. In a small scale user study we illustrate our key idea which is that common utterances, i.e., those with high alignment scores with a community (community classifier confidence scores) are unlikely to be regarded taboo. Annotators who are community members contradict taboo classification decisions and annotations in a majority of instances.

The data were collected and combined with other information about the players from available online data services. It presents a scoring scheme to enable identification of cyberbullying based on current research. Classification of the collected data was carried out using simple feature detection with SQL database queries and compared to classification from AI-based sentiment text analysis services that have recently become available and further against manually classified data using a custom-built classification client built for this paper. The simple SQL classification proved to be quite useful at identifying some features of toxic chat such as the use of bad language or racist sentiments, however the classification by the more sophisticated online sentiment analysis services proved to be disappointing. The results were then examined for insights into cyberbullying within this game and it was shown that it should be possible to reduce cyberbullying within the World of Tanks game by a significant factor by simply freezing the player's ability to communicate through the in-game chat function for a short period after the player is killed within a match. It was also shown that very new players are much less likely to engage in cyberbullying, suggesting that it may be a learned behaviour from other players. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The analysis of social media data allows us to model the relationship between different constructs and provides an important source of knowledge about society. The results obtained allowed us to extract those elements that are common to the analyzed data and those that are unique. Sentiment analysis was also conducted. Based on the different analyses, a relational model was developed and tested for 5 hashtags. Satisfactory results were obtained for 3 hashtags, allowing hashtag detection without knowledge of the hashtag for the text being analyzed.",,,978-9-492-85918-1,207-215, , 35th Annual European Simulation and Modelling Conference (ESM)35th Annual European Simulation and Modelling Conference (ESM) ,

Such platforms provide users with interactive options such as likes, dislikes as well as a way of expressing their opinions in the form of text (i.e., comments). The ability of posting comments on these online platforms has allowed some users to post racist, obscene, as well as to spread hate on these platforms. In some cases, this kind of toxic behavior might turn the comment section from a space where users can share their views to a place where hate and profanity are spread. Such issues are observed across various social media platforms and many users are often exposed to these kinds of behaviors which requires comment moderators to spend a lot of time filtering out such inappropriate comments. Moreover, such textual inappropriate contents can be targeted towards users irrespective of age, concerning variety of topics (not only controversial), and triggered by various events. My doctoral dissertation work, therefore, is primarily focused on studying, detecting and analyzing users exposure to this kind of toxicity on different social media platforms utilizing the state-of-art techniques in deep learning and natural language processing. This paper presents one example of my works on detecting and measuring kids exposure to inappropriate comments posted on YouTube videos targeting young users. In the meantime, the same pipeline is being examined for measuring users interaction with mainstream news media and sentiment towards various topics in the public discourse in light of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).",,,978-1-4503-6859-9,3213-3216, , 29th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM)29th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM) ,

Yet, its underlying mechanism, deep learning-based text classification (DLTC), is inherently vulnerable to maliciously crafted adversarial texts. To mitigate such vulnerabilities, intensive research has been conducted on strengthening English-based DLTC models. However, the existing defenses are not effective for Chinese-based DLTC models, due to the unique sparseness, diversity, and variation of the Chinese language.In this paper, we bridge this striking gap by presenting TEXTSHIELD, a new adversarial defense framework specifically designed for Chinese-based DLTC models. TEXTSHIELD differs from previous work in several key aspects: (i) generic - it applies to any Chinese-based DLTC models without requiring re-training; (ii) robust - it significantly reduces the attack success rate even under the setting of adaptive attacks; and (iii) accurate - it has little impact on the performance of DLTC models over legitimate inputs. Extensive evaluations show that it outperforms both existing methods and the industry-leading platforms.

Due to these threats, people stop expressing themselves and give up on seeking different opinions. Recent research efforts focus on examining the strengths and weaknesses (e.g. potential unintended biases) of using machine learning as a support tool to facilitate safe space for online discussions; for example, through detecting various types of negative online behaviors such as hate speech, online harassment, or cyberbullying. Typically, these efforts build upon sentiment analysis or spam detection in text. However, the toxicity of the language could be a strong indicator for the intensity of the negative behavior. In this paper, we study the topic of toxicity in online conversations by addressing the problems of subjectivity, bias, and ambiguity inherent in this task. We start with an analysis of the characteristics of subjective assessment tasks (e.g. relevance judgment, toxicity judgment, sentiment assessment, etc). Whether we perceive something as relevant or as toxic can be influenced by almost infinite amounts of prior or current context, e.g. culture, background, experiences, education, etc. We survey recent work that tries to understand this phenomenon, and we outline a number of open questions and challenges which shape the research perspectives in this multi-disciplinary field.",,,978-1-4503-6675-5,1100-1105, , World Wide Web Conference (WWW)World Wide Web Conference (WWW) ,

Moreover, manual annotation by human annotators can lead to varying degrees of competency, training, and experience, which can result in inconsistent labeling and arbitrary standards. To address these challenges, researchers have been exploring automated methods for enhancing training and testing datasets. This paper proposes SRL-ACO, a novel text augmentation framework that leverages Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) techniques to generate additional training data for natural language processing (NLP) models. The framework uses SRL to identify the semantic roles of words in a sentence and ACO to generate new sentences that preserve these roles. SRL-ACO can enhance the accuracy of NLP models by generating additional data without requiring manual data annotation. The paper presents experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of SRL-ACO on seven text classification datasets for sentiment analysis, toxic text detection and sarcasm identification. The results show that SRL-ACO improves the performance of a classifier on different NLP tasks. These results demonstrate that SRL-ACO has the potential to enhance the quality and quantity of training data for various NLP tasks. (c) 2023 The Author(s).

This paper focuses on the problem of identifying online hatred-vulnerable videos where the videos themselves do not contain any hateful content but unexpectedly trigger hateful comments from the audience. It is suboptimal to simply treat the hatred-vulnerable videos as hateful ones and remove them from the sharing platforms. This will discourage the uploaders of such videos from sharing valid and informative videos in the future. However, treating these hatred-vulnerable videos as hatred-free ones will provide undesirable opportunities for hateful users to spread their toxic comments and extreme ideology. In this paper, we develop VulnerCheck, an end-to-end supervised learning approach to effectively classify hatred-vulnerable videos from hateful and hatred-free ones by exploring the structure and semantics features of audience's comment networks. VulnerCheck is content-agnostic in the sense that it does not analyze the content of the video and is therefore robust against sophisticated content creators who craft hateful videos to bypass the current content censorship. We evaluate VulnerCheck on a real-world dataset collected from YouTube.

The extent of land use and cover changes derived from those collapses were an expression of their impacts. Thus, knowing the changes to land use and cover after these disasters is essential to help repair or mitigate environmental degradation. This study aimed to diagnose the changes to land cover that occurred after the failure of dam B1 in Brumadinho that affected the Ferro-Carvao stream watershed. In addition to the environmental objective, there was the intention of investigating the impact of image preparation, as well as the spatial and spectral resolution on the classification's accuracy. To accomplish the goals, visible and near-infrared bands from Landsat (30 m), Sentinel-2 (10 m), and PlanetScope Dove (4.77 m) images collected between 2018 and 2021 were processed on the Google Earth Engine platform. The Pixel Reduction to Median tool was used to prepare the record of images, and then the random forest algorithm was used to detect the changes in land cover caused by the tailings dam failure under the different spatial and spectral resolutions and to provide the corresponding measures of accuracy. The results showed that the spatial resolution of the images affects the accuracy, but also that the selected algorithm and images were all capable of accurately classifying land use and cover in the Ferro-Carvao watershed and their changes over time.

Then, we investigated the effect of algae on the combined toxicity of MPs and Pb. We observed that, MPs significantly increased Pb toxicity, which was related to the increase in soluble Pb concentration and the intake of Pb-loaded MPs, both of which increased the accumulation of Pb inC. dubia. The presence of algae mitigated the combined toxicity of MPs and Pb, although algae alone increased Pb accumulation. Therefore, the toxicity mitigation through algae uptake came from mechanisms other than Pb accumulation, which will need further investigation.

Since the acceptance of sustainable product innovations such as CO2-based fuels depends on an individual's acceptance decision based on perceived risks and benefits, this study focuses on subjective risk perceptions of fuel toxicity. An online survey was conducted to assess risk evaluations of CO2-based fuels regarding various risk targets, exposure characteristics, negative outcomes for health and environment, and frequency of health impairments. CO2-based fuels were significantly more positively perceived than conventional fuels and were found to be perceived to pose less risks regarding types of exposure and properties leading to toxic effects. For both aviation and road traffic the acceptance of CO2-based fuels increased with decreasing fear of health and environmental consequences and the less frequently health effects were assessed. The findings allow to derive implications for risk assessment and communication strategies in the development and roll-out of CO2-based fuels.",2296-598X,,,, ,  ,

The aim of the proposed strategy is to minimise the impact of a toxic influent shock load on process performance. To do this, the strategy depends on a respiration rate measurement to detect toxic events and uses an equalisation tank to store toxic influent. A defined control algorithm specific for the benchmark plant was developed and controls the reintroduction of the stored influent back into the process stream once the influent is deemed non-toxic. Implemented into the benchmark-defined nitrifying configuration, the evaluation required several alterations to the simulation benchmark including three model changes, the addition of a soluble unbiodegradable toxic state variable and the development of two toxic influent files: The results of the simulations indicate that the impact of the toxicant can be significantly mitigated through the use of off-line storage and reintroduction of suspected influent.

PoDyP4 was demonstrated that the ability to almost completely degrade ZEN at pH6.0 and 40°C for 2h, even at high concentrations of 1mM. The promotion of enzymatic degradation of ZEN was most pronounced in the presence of Mg2+, while Cu2+ and Fe2+ exhibited a notable inhibitory effect. The degradation mechanism elucidated the detoxification of ZEN by PoDyP4 through hydroxylation and polymerization reactions. The resulting metabolic products displayed significantly reduced toxicity and minimal impact on the viability and apoptosis of mouse spermatocytes GC-2 cells, in comparison to the original ZEN.

As a typical organic pollutant, PFOA has been extensively found in wildlife and human bodies, and can preferentially bind to serum albumin in vivo. However, the importance of protein-PFOA interactions on the cytotoxic-ity of PFOA could not be stressed enough. In this study, we used both experimental and theoretical approaches, to in-vestigate the interactions of PFOA with bovine serum albumin (BSA, the most abundant protein in blood). It was found that PFOA could mainly interact with Sudlow site I of BSA to form BSA-PFOA complex, in which van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonds played dominant roles. Moreover, the strong binding of BSA could greatly alter the cellular uptake and distribution of PFOA in human endothelial cells, and result in the decreases of reactive oxygen species formation and cytotoxicity for these BSA-coated PFOA. Consistently, the addition of fetal bovine serum into cell culture medium also significantly mitigated PFOA-induced cytotoxicity, which was attributed to the extracellular complexation be-tween PFOA and serum proteins.

However, nanotechnology is an emerging technology which has potential health and safety risks throughout its product life cycle. The health risk of a nanoparticle is a function of both its hazard to human health and its exposure potential. It is prudent for companies to try to mitigate the potential risks of nanoparticles during the design stage rather than downstream during manufacturing or customer use. The intent of this paper is to propose five design principles for product designers to use during the design stage for products that contain nanoparticles. By using these design principles, the health risk of the nanoparticle may be mitigated by potentially lowering the hazard and/or the exposure potential of the nanoparticle. These proposed design principles are largely untested and are offered as an initial framework that will require more testing, validation, and refinement. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we investigated the mechanism of Cd-induced mitochondrial toxicity in bovine in vitro matured oocytes, primary cultured bovine cumulus cells, and in vitro developed bovine embryos. Cd significantly reduced PPARGC1A (PGC-1a) and nuclear respiratory factors, which leads to mitochondrial damage and hence reduction in oocyte maturation and embryo development. NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) is the upstream marker of PGC-1a and nuclear respiratory factors, and its activation significantly mitigated Cd-induced mitochondrial damage. For SIRT1 activation, we used Hesperetin (Hsp), a citrus flavonoid and a potent activator of SIRT1. The molecular docking approach was used to investigate the binding of hesperetin to bovine SIRT1, which revealed that hesperetin creates polar and non-polar interactions with residues that are reported essential for the activation of SIRT1. Furthermore, the SIRT1 enzymatic activity was measured in primary cultured bovine granulosa cells after hesperetin treatment. To further confirm the SIRT1-dependent effects of hesperetin we used a specific inhibitor of SIRT1 (EX527), which significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the effects of hesperetin on embryo mitochondria. Next, we treated hesperetin and Cd to early bovine embryos and discovered a significant (p 0.05) increase in PGC-1, NRF1, and NFE2L2 protein expression as well as embryo development recovery. Thus, we came to the conclusion that hesperetin can activate PGC-1 and nuclear respiratory factors via SIRT1, which can greatly reduce Cd-induced mitochondrial toxicity and promote mitochondrial biogenesis in early bovine embryos.(c) 2022 The Authors.

For this, we develop a stochastic aging-model to describe the behavior of aged printed resistors and modify the training objective by considering the expected loss over the lifetime of the device. This approach ensures to provide acceptable accuracy over the device lifetime. Our experiments show that an overall 35.8% improvement in terms of expected accuracy over the device lifetime can be achieved using the proposed learning approach.",1933-7760,,978-1-4503-9217-4,, , IEEE/ACM 41st International Conference on Computer Aided-Design (ICCAD)IEEE/ACM 41st International Conference on Computer Aided-Design (ICCAD) ,

Thiamethoxam (TMX) is extensively used in agriculture and is gradually occupying the market for traditional pesticides. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate whether selenomethionine (SeMet) could affect the survival rate, bioaccumulation of TMX, serum biochemical parameters, lipid peroxidation, antioxidants in the hepatopancreas, and expression of stress genes after exposure of red swamp crayfish to 10 ppt TMX for 7 days. The results showed that the survival rate significantly increased and the bioaccumulation of TMX significantly decreased with SeMet administration (P < 0.05). Furthermore, severe histological damage to the hepatopancreas of red crayfish was observed after exposure to TMX; however, this damage was alleviated after SeMet administration. SeMet also significantly reduced the TMX-induced changes in serum biochemical parameters, malondialdehyde content, and antioxidant enzyme activity in crayfish hepatopancreas (P < 0.05). Notably, analysis of the expression of 10 stress response genes showed that 0.5 mg/kg SeMet might decrease cell damage in the hepatopancreas. Consequently, our findings suggest that higher levels of TMX in crayfish may cause hepatopancreatic cell toxicity, which can be harmful to human health; however, SeMet could mitigate these effects, providing an understanding of pesticide compounds and food safety.",0304-3894,1873-3336,,, ,  ,

Therefore, this study for the first time elevated the effects of beeswax waste biochar (a novel organic amendment) on Cd uptake, biomass, antioxidant enzymes activities and some physiobiochemical characteristics in saffron exposed to Cd stress. The treatments were consisted four Cd concentrations (0, 3, 6 and 9 mg kg(-1) soil) together with four biochar levels (0%, 1.5%, 3.0% and 6% w/w). The results showed that Cd uptake in saffron corm and leaf tissues was significantly elevated by increase in Cd stress, but this parameter in flower and stigma (as edible part of saffron) was unchanged. Application of Cd caused decrease in plant biomass which was found to recover with the amendment of biochar. The translocation factor values were less than 1 in all the treatments, demonstrating saffron can be considered as a candidate plant for cadmium phytostabilization. Cadmium-induced oxidative stress stimulated malondialdehyde content, and activity of superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase, catalase and glutathione reductase enzymes, while biochar application alleviated the oxidative damages. Crocin component was significantly raised along with increase in Cd concentration. Meanwhile, biochar application declined crocin and increased picrocrocin contents. In conclusion, beeswax waste biochar can mitigate Cd toxicity in saffron by inducing soil alkalinization, immobilizing Cd in soil, reducing Cd partitioning in the aboveground tissues and regulating Cd induced oxidative damage, consequently contributing to lowering the potential risks of Cd pollution.

Cathode ray tubes (CRTs) used as display screen for computer monitors and televisions contains large quantities of lead, estimated at between 0.5 and 4 kg, depending on the size of the CRT and has been identified as the most polluting of all electronic waste components. Having failed the tests used in the toxicity characterization of solid wastes, CRTs have been declared 'hazardous' and subsequently banned from landfills and incinerators in most developed countries. Presently, large quantities of CRTs are generated globally with only few developed countries having effective take back and sound management program. Meanwhile, large quantities of CRT-containing devices are being moved across frontiers into developing countries in the name of 'reuse' and 'bridging the digital divide'. With near absence of recycling infrastructure for electronic wastes in most developing countries, waste CRTs are disposed of with MSW at open dumps and unsanitary landfills. This paper reviews the current practices in the management of CRTs around the world, with emphasis on the role of regulations, availability of recycling infrastructure, recycling/reuse routes, and export into developing countries. Inappropriate disposal of waste CRTs creates the opportunity for large-scale environmental contamination with heavy metals, especially lead. Appropriate disposal routes are required globally in the management of CRTs in order to mitigate environmental contamination and human exposure to toxins. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The application of PGPR as biofertilizers and atmospheric nitrogen fixators contributes considerably to the intensification of the phytoremediation process. In this paper, we have built a system consisting of rhizospheric Azotobacter microbial populations and Lepidium sativum plants, growing in solutions containing heavy metals in various concentrations. We examined the ability of the organisms to grow in symbiosis so as to stimulate the plant growth and enhance its tolerance to Cr(VI) and Cd(II), to ultimately provide a reliable phytoremediation system. The study was developed at the laboratory level and, at this stage, does not assess the inherent interactions under real conditions occurring in contaminated fields with autochthonous microflora and under different pedoclimatic conditions and environmental stresses. Azotobacter sp. bacteria could indeed stimulate the average germination efficiency of Lepidium sativum by almost 7%, average root length by 22%, average stem length by 34% and dry biomass by 53%. The growth of L. sativum has been affected to a greater extent in Cd(II) solutions due its higher toxicity compared to that of Cr(VI). The reduced tolerance index (TI, %) indicated that plant growth in symbiosis with PGPR was however affected by heavy metal toxicity, while the tolerance of the plant to heavy metals was enhanced in the bacteria-plant system.A methodology based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) and differential evolution (DE), specifically a neuro-evolutionary approach, was applied to model germination rates, dry biomass and root/stem length and proving the robustness of the experimental data. The errors associated with all four variables are small and the correlation coefficients higher than 0.98, which indicate that the selected models can efficiently predict the experimental data.

The definite source identification of atmospheric Pb is the key step to mitigate this pollution. Here, we first report an overlooked source of atmospheric nanosized Pb particles using transmission electron microscopy and bulk sample analyses, finding that residential honeycomb briquette combustion emits large numbers of nanosized Pbrich particles. We found that 33.7 +/- 19.9 % of primary particles by number from residential honeycomb briquette combustion contains the crystalline Pb particles. These Pb-rich particles range in size from 14 to 956 nm with a mean diameter of 117 nm. Compared with raw coal chunks, honeycomb briquette combustion could emit less carbonaceous particles, but largely increase nanosized Pb particle emissions. This result is attributed to two key factors: (1) higher Pb content in honeycomb briquette (63.6 mu g g- 1) than that in coal chunk (8.5 mu g g-1), and (2) higher Pb release rate for honeycomb briquette (62.3 %) caused by honeycomb structure than that for coal chunk (20.1 %).

This allows polyplexes to maintain a positive surface charge and provide high levels of gene expression in live cells. Notably, comb polymers with nearly 50 mol % SB form polyplexes that exhibit positive surface charge similarly as polyplexes formed from purely cationic comb polymers, indicating the ability to introduce an appreciable amount of SB functionality without screening surface charge.

This tutorial introduces the language of measurement modeling from the quantitative social sciences as a framework for examining how social, organizational, and political values enter computational systems and unpacking the varied normative concerns operationalized in different techniques for measuring bias. We showthat this framework helps to clarify the way unobservable theoretical constructs-such as creditworthiness, risk to society, or tweet toxicity-are turned into measurable quantities and how this process may introduce fairness-related harms. In particular, we demonstrate howto systematically assess the construct validity and reliability of these measurements to detect and characterize specific types of harms, which arise from mismatches between constructs and their operationalizations. We then take a critical look at existing approaches to examining bias in NLP models, ranging from work on embedding spaces to machine translation and hate speech detection. We show that measurement modeling can help uncover the implicit constructs that suchwork aims to capture when measuring bias. In so doing, we illustrate the limits of current debiasing techniques, which have obscured the specific harms whose measurements they implicitly aim to reduce.

The current study aimed to investigate the potential protective effects of car-vacrol as well as its underlying mechanism against vancomycin-induced nephrotoxicity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The animals were randomly classified into four groups (8 rats per group). Group I, which served as a control group, received only vehicles. Group II received a single i.p. injection of 50 mg/kg of carvacrol for seven days. Group III received vancomycin (200 mg/kg, i.p.) as a singular daily dose for sev-en days. Carvacrol was administered to Group IV seven days prior to the daily vancomycin dose. RESULTS: The results revealed that carvacrol minimized vancomycin-induced renal injury as evidenced by lower serum cystatin C levels and kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), in addition to a decline in renal damage caused by vancomycin as indicated in histopathological assessment. Furthermore, carvacrol significantly attenuat- ed oxidative stress parameters and inflammato-ry mediators.

Molecular docking and dynamic simulations explored PS-NPs' interactions with mitochondrial complexes. We further probed mitophagy's pivotal role in PS-NP-induced mitochondrial damage and examined melatonin's ameliorative potential in vitro. We validated melatonin's intervention (intraperitoneal, 10mg/kg/d) in C57BL/6J mice exposed to 250mg/kg/d of PS-NPs for 28days.RESULTS: In our in vitro experiments, we observed PS-NP accumulation in cells, including mitochondria, leading to cell toxicity and reduced viability. Notably, antioxidant treatment failed to fully rescue viability, suggesting reactive oxygen species (ROS)-independent cytotoxicity. PS-NPs caused significant mitochondrial damage, characterized by altered morphology, reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, and decreased ATP production. Subsequent investigations pointed to PS-NP-induced disruption of mitochondrial respiration, potentially through interference with complex I (CI), a concept supported by molecular docking studies highlighting the influence of PS-NPs on CI. Rescue experiments using an AMPK pathway inhibitor (compound C) and an autophagy inhibitor (3-methyladenine) revealed that excessive mitophagy was induced through AMPK/ULK1 pathway activation, worsening mitochondrial damage and subsequent cell death in differentiated SH-SY5Y cells. Notably, we identified melatonin as a potential protective agent, capable of alleviating PS-NP-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Lastly, our in vivo experiments demonstrated that melatonin could mitigate dopaminergic neuron loss and motor impairments by restoring mitophagy regulation in mice.CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that PS-NPs disrupt mitochondrial function by affecting CI, leading to excessive mitophagy through the AMPK/ULK1 pathway, causing dopaminergic neuron death. Melatonin can counteract PS-NP-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and motor impairments by regulating mitochondrial autophagy. These findings offer novel insights into the MNP-induced PD-like neurodegenerative mechanisms, and highlight melatonin's protective potential in mitigating the MNP's environmental risk.",,1743-8977,,44-44, ,  ,

The impact of this NPs release on the fate and toxicity of coexisting heavy metals is largely unknown. In this work, a series of hydroponic experiments were conducted to investigate impact of four types of TiO2 NPs, including one anatase (NAnT), one pristine rutile (NRuT) and two rutiles with hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces (NLRuT, NBRuT), as well as the bulk particles (BT), on the bioaccumulation of lead (Pb) by rice (Oryza sativa) seedlings. The results indicate that TiO2 NPs exposure at the levels of 10 and 1000 mg/L had no significant adverse effects on the growth and development of rice seedlings. Due to its small crystallite size (252.2 angstrom), only one type of TiO2 NPs (NAnT) entered rice seedling roots through an apoplastic route. However, NAnT particles were not translocated from roots to shoots, likely due to the obstruction effects of casparian strip in the root tissues. Both nano and bulk TiO2 reduced the bioaccumulation of Pb in rice at high TiO2 exposure levels (1000 mg/L) but the extent of the reduction was TiO2-type dependent. NAnT, NRuT and NLRuT reduced the Pb concentration in rice roots by >80% and by 77-97% in shoots, likely due to the particles high sorption potential for Pb in the nutrient solution. NBRuT and BT reduced Pb levels by 45-61% in roots and 11-38% in shoots. Although NAnT was able to effectively reduce the bioaccumulation of Pb in rice tissues, this particle did accumulate in rice roots, which poses a potential risk to food safety. Accordingly, NAnT is not recommended for Pb pollution control. NRuT and NLRuT are more appropriate agents to reduce Pb contamination threats to rice plants, which in turn may mitigate health risk to humans through the food chain. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Quinoa genotype, Puno was grown on soil contaminated with various levels of arsenite; 0, 10, 20, 30, and 40 mg As kg(-1) soil. Results revealed that plant growth, photosynthetic pigments, stomatal conductance, and grain yield of As treated plants were significantly less as compared to control plants. Plants exposed to elevated levels of 30 and 40 mg As kg(-1) of soil could not survive until maturity. Plant roots retained higher concentration of As than shoot indicating As phytostabilizing behavior of quinoa. Arsenic toxicity caused oxidative stress in quinoa plants, which elevated the H2O2 and TBARS contents and decreased membrane stability. This oxidative stress was partly mitigated by the induction of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, POD, APX). Perhaps, our results regarding As availability might be an overestimate of the typical natural conditions, As accumulation in quinoa grains posed both carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic health risks to humans.

Standing-stock surveys were used to collect primary litter data, while questionnaire surveys were used to learn about people's perception and attitude towards the plastic pollution problem in the study area. We found that plastic was the most common component of the litter at all the sites and that it was primarily of terrestrial origin. Compared to non-protected sites, GOKMPA had the lowest litter density but the highest proportion of plastic litter. Single-use plastic bottles were the most counted items at all the sites, regardless of the conservation status of the sites. The majority of people (locals, visitors, and fishers) around these sites expressed concern about waste but were hesitant to take responsibility and discourage or prevent littering. We noted that designating coastal territories as protected areas helps in reducing plastic pollution while also conserving habitat and biodiversity. However, this could change rapidly due to either mishandling of litter within MPAs or neighboring non-PAs, and also because plastics pose an actual toxicity risk when present even at minimal concentrations in the environment. We recommend combining preventive, mitigating, and curative measures in areas where risk hotspots for plastic litter are identified, and such sites must be constantly monitored.

Peroxynitrite and its decomposition products cause multiple deleterious effects including tyrosine nitration of proteins, superoxide dismutase (SOD) inactivation, and tissue damage. Studies have shown that peroxynitrite formation during endothelial dysfunction is strongly dependent on the NO and O-2(center dot-) production rates. Previous experimental and modeling studies examining the role of NO and O-2(center dot-) production imbalance on peroxynitrite formation showed different results in biological and synthetic systems. However, there is a lack of quantitative information about the formation and biological relevance of peroxynitrite under oxidative, nitroxidative, and nitrosative stress conditions in the microcirculation. We developed a computational biotransport model to examine the role of endothelial NO and O-2(center dot-) production on the complex biochemical NO and O-2(center dot-) interactions in the microcirculation. We also modeled the effect of variability in SOD expression and activity during oxidative stress. The results showed that peroxynitrite concentration increased with increase in either O-2(center dot-) to NO or NO to O-2(center dot-) production rate ratio (Q(O2)(center dot-)/Q(NO) or Q(NO)/Q(O2)(center dot-) , respectively). The peroxynitrite concentrations were similar for both production rate ratios, indicating that peroxynitrite-related nitroxidative and nitrosative stresses may be similar in endothelial dysfunction or inducible NO synthase (iNOS)-induced NO production. The endothelial peroxynitrite concentration increased with increase in both Q(O2)(center dot-)/Q(NO) and Q(NO)/Q(O2)(center dot-) ratios at SOD concentrations of 0.1-100 mu M. The absence of SOD may not mitigate the extent of peroxynitrite-mediated toxicity, as we predicted an insignificant increase in peroxynitrite levels beyond Q(O2)(center dot-)/Q(NO) and Q(NO)/Q(O2)(center dot-) ratios of 1. The results support the experimental observations of biological systems and show that peroxynitrite formation increases with increase in either NO or O-2(center dot-) production, and excess NO production from iNOS or from NO donors during oxidative stress conditions does not reduce the extent of peroxynitrite mediated toxicity.

Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have recently attracted a lot of attention as potential absorbents to mitigate carbon dioxide CO2 emissions because of their large CO2 capacities and stability under diverse conditions. Designing a potent DES requires knowledge of molecular-level understanding including structure, dynamics, and interfacial properties in DESs. In this study, we investigate the CO2 sorption and diffusion in different DESs at different temperatures and pressure using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Our results demonstrate that CO2 molecules preferentially concentrate at the CO2-DES interface, and the diffusion of CO2 in bulk DESs increases with increasing pressure and temperature.

This research undertook a life cycle assessment (LCA) for LABs used in e-bikes in China. Its purpose was to identify the key materials and processes that contribute most to impacts on the environment and public health within the life cycle of LABs, from materials extraction and processing, manufacture, transportation, use, and end-of-life. It also sought to find opportunities for improving the environmental profile of LABs. The results indicate that LABs use, as well as materials extraction and processing, have the largest environmental impacts within the life cycle of LABs. The former is responsible for 84% of the primary energy use and contributes the highest potentials to energy-related impacts, including global warming (86%) and acidification (69%). The latter, specifically the lead used in batteries, is the most important driver of impacts such as ozone depletion, photochemical smog, eutrophication, and carcinogenicity. Accordingly, battery reuse after refurbishment and recovery of materials in the end-of-life stage could significantly mitigate most of the overall life cycle impacts by reducing the consumption of virgin materials. However, currently, 95% of total lead emissions are released in the end-of-life stage due to improper management of the spent LABs recycling market in China, and these emissions causes 90% of total human toxicity potential. Battery manufacture only accounts for 3% of total lead emissions after the national cleanup action for heavy metal pollution. Moreover, sensitivity coefficients are employed to evaluate the reliability and uncertainty of the LCA results. Based on the findings, there are several substantial opportunities to further reduce the overall environmental impacts of LABs, such as prolonging the lifetime of LABs, reducing the consumption of metals in LABs, and improving the technology and management in the recovery of spent LABs.

This study aimed to establish a novel yet simple approach for estimating total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) runoff losses from regional paddy fields. In this approach, temporal changes of nutrient concentrations in floodwater were coupled with runoff-processing functions in rice (Oryza sativa L.) fields to calculate nutrient runoff losses for three site-specific field experiments. Validation experiments verified the accuracy of this method. The geographic information system technique was used to upscale and visualize the TN and TP runoff losses from field to regional scales. The results indicated that nutrient runoff losses had significant spatio-temporal variation characteristics during rice seasons, which were positively related to fertilizer rate and precipitation. The average runoff losses over five study seasons were 20.21 kg N ha(-1) for TN and 0.76 kg P ha(-1) for TP. Scenario analysis showed that TN and TP losses dropped by 7.64 and 3.0%, respectively, for each 10% reduction of fertilizer input.

High-sorption CNMs exhibited lithe or suppression effect on phenanthrene and 3-methylphenanthrene bioaccumulation, whereas these treatments stimulated 3,6-dimethylphenanthrene bioaccumulation (6.1-25.9%), indicating a dissimilar role of CNMs on contaminant uptake as a function of analyte type. Compared to the single-contaminant system, the alleviated suppression effect of certain CNM treatments on bioaccumulation of both compounds in F2 system, as well as the sorption-and dose-dependent bioavailability of two methylphenanthrenes in F3 system revealed significant and dissimilar molecular interactions in multi-contaminant systems. CNMs mitigated the synergetic bioaccumulation of three compounds except for 3,6-dimethylphenanthrene under MW8 co-exposure. Oxidative stress did occur in all three systems but only high-level CNMs in F3 system triggered significant damage with considerable MDA (malondialdehyde) generated in earthworms.

However, the performance of common clinical dose calculation algorithms in airways has not been thoroughly studied. Airways are of particular concern because their small size and the density differences they create have the potential to hinder dose calculation accuracy. To address this gap in knowledge, here we investigate dosimetric accuracy in airways of two commonly used dose calculation algorithms, the anisotropic analytical algorithm (AAA) and Acuros-XB (AXB), recreating clinical treatment plans on a cohort of four SAbR patients. A virtual bronchoscopy software was used to delineate 856 airways on a high-resolution breath-hold CT (BHCT) image acquired for each patient. The planning target volumes (PTVs) and standard thoracic OARs were contoured on an average CT (AVG) image over the breathing cycle. Conformal and intensity-modulated radiation therapy plans were recreated on the BHCT image and on the AVG image, for a total of four plan types per patient. Dose calculations were performed using AAA and AXB, and the differences in maximum and mean dose in each structure were calculated. The median differences in maximum dose among all airways were <= 0.3Gy in magnitude for all four plan types. With airways grouped by dose-to-structure or diameter, median dose differences were still <= 0.5Gy in magnitude, with no clear dependence on airway size. These results, along with our previous airway radiosensitivity works, suggest that dose differences between AAA and AXB correspond to an airway collapse variation <= 0.7% in magnitude. This variation in airway injury risk can be considered as not clinically relevant, and the use of either AAA or AXB is therefore appropriate when including patient airways as individual OARs so as to reduce risk of radiation-induced lung toxicity.",2057-1976,,,, ,  ,

In order to mitigate future impacts from such materials, assessment methods that can provide early indications of potential environmental risk are required. This paper presents a further development and testing of an environmental risk screening method based on two proxy measures: aquatic ecotoxicity and global annual production volumes. In addition to considering current production volumes, this further developed method considers potential future production volumes, thereby enabling prospective environmental risk screening. The proxy measures are applied to seven advanced materials: graphene, graphene oxide, nanocellulose, nanodiamond, quantum dots, nano-sized molybdenum disulfide, and MXenes. Only MXenes show high aquatic ecotoxicity, though the number of test results is still very limited. While current production volumes are relatively modest for most materials, several of the materials (graphene, graphene oxide, nanocellulose, nano-sized molybdenum disulfide, and MXenes) have the potential to become high-volume materials in the future. For MXenes, with both high aquatic ecotoxicity and high potential future production volumes, more detailed environmental risk assessments should be considered. For the other materials with high potential future production volumes, the recommendation is to continuously monitor their aquatic ecotoxicity data. Based on the application of the proxy measures combined with future scenarios for production volumes, we recommend this environmental risk screening method be used in the early development of advanced materials to prioritize which advanced materials should be subject to more detailed environmental assessments.",2452-0748,,,, ,  ,

Less is known however, on the impacts that flow from the use of arsenic rich groundwater for irrigation or the effectiveness of arsenic remediation in agricultural systems. To partially fill this gap, we review 29 studies that examine the consequences of irrigating with arsenic contaminated groundwater and 28 studies which evaluate interventions aimed at reducing its negative impacts on human health and crops. These studies are geographically limited to West Bengal and Bangladesh (Bengal plains) as these regions constitute hubs of concerns for groundwater contamination. These studies show that there are six broad categories of interventions: deficit irrigation; soil fertilization; growing alternative field crops (other than paddy); switching to arsenic tolerant paddy cultivars; cooking methods to reduce arsenic content in rice and nutritional supplements. Importantly, these efforts target different stages of the agri-food system, some intervene in production processes and balance concerns for crop yields and human health while others focus on consumption practices and only mitigate health risks. Despite this diversity in focus, our results indicate that all treatments have positive effects, either in reducing As content in grains, its accumulation in soil and/or increase crop yields compared to control groups.

ILs are composed of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium (BMIM) cations, paired with five different anions of varying hydrophilicity Gland size, namely, Cl-, NO3-, BF4-, PF6-, and NTf2-. REMD simulations greatly improve structure sampling and mitigate bias toward the initial folded peptide structure, thereby providing more adequate simulations to study protein stability. Cluster analysis, DSSP analysis and derivation of radius of gyration, interaction energies, and hydrogen bonding are used to quantify structural peptide changes in a large temperature range from 250 to 650 K. alpha-Peptides are least stable in ILs that contain small anions with localized negative charge, such as in BMIM-Cl and BMIM-NO3. Destabilization is caused by direct electrostatic interactions of anions with alpha-helices that are exposed to the solvent. This destabilization is characterized not by unfolded but instead by compact misfolded structures. Also, beta-peptides retain compact structures up to at least 400 K, below which unfolding hardly occurs. However, intrapeptide hydrogen bonds that constitute the beta-sheet are not exposed to the solvent. Therefore, beta-peptides are generally more stable than alpha-peptides in all considered ILs. Moreover, on contrary to alpha-peptides, beta-peptides are least stable in less polar ILs, such as BMIM-PF6 and BMIM-NTf2, because dissolving beta-sheets requires large structural changes of the peptide. Such transitions are energetically less opposed in ILs with weaker mutual ion coordination. A large interaction density within ILs, for example, in BMIM-Cl, is thus kinetically trapping beta-peptides in the original folded state. Additionally, in BMIM-BF4, interactions with beta-peptides are so weak, compared to an aqueous solvent, resulting in stronger interactions within the peptide, which extend beta-sheets, hence causing misfolding of a different kind. The results reveal how direct ion-peptide interactions and solvent reorganization energy in ILs are both crucial in determining protein stability. These insights could translate into guidelines for the design of new IL solvents with improved protein stability.",1520-6106,1520-5207,,9274-9288, ,  ,

We found that the weakened hydrophobic interaction between the hydrophobic amino acid residues and hydrophobic substituents at the binding site of PCB derivatives and human oestrogen receptor alpha (hER alpha) was the main reason for the weakened binding force and reduced anti-oestrogenic activity. It was consistent with the information that the hydrophobic field displayed by the 3D contour maps in the constructed oestrogen activity CoMSIA model was one of the main influencing force fields. The hydrophobic interaction between PCB derivatives and oestrogen-active receptors was negatively correlated with the average distance between hydrophobic substituents and hydrophobic amino acid residues at the hER alpha-binding site, and positively correlated with the number of hydrophobic amino acid residues. In other words, the smaller the average distance between the hydrophobic amino acid residues at the binding sites between the two and the more the number of them, and the stronger the oestrogen activity expression degree of PCBS derivative molecules. Therefore, hydrophobic interactions between PCB derivatives and the oestrogen receptor can be reduced by altering the microenvironmental conditions in humans.

Hope that AI will revolutionize health care delivery and improve clinical outcomes has been accompanied by concerns about the impact of these technologies on health equity.Objective: We aimed to conduct a scoping review of the literature to address the question, What are the current and potential impacts of AI technologies on health equity in oncology?Methods: Following PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines for scoping reviews, we systematically searched MEDLINE and Embase electronic databases from January 2000 to August 2021 for records engaging with key concepts of AI, health equity, and oncology. We included all English-language articles that engaged with the 3 key concepts. Articles were analyzed qualitatively for themes pertaining to the influence of AI on health equity in oncology.Results: Of the 14,011 records, 133 (0.95%) identified from our review were included. We identified 3 general themes in the literature: the use of AI to reduce health care disparities (58/133, 43.6%), concerns surrounding AI technologies and bias (16/133, 12.1%), and the use of AI to examine biological and social determinants of health (55/133, 41.4%).

However, it has been demonstrated that NLP systems learn gender bias from the corpora of documents on which they are trained. It is increasingly common for pre-trained models to be used as a starting point for building applications in a wide range of areas including critical decision making applications. It is also very easy to use a pre-trained model as the basis for a new application without careful consideration of the original nature of the training set. In this paper, we quantify the degree to which gender bias differs with the corpora used for training. We look especially at the impact of starting with a pre-trained model and fine-tuning with additional data. Specifically, we calculate a measure of direct gender bias on several pre-trained models including BERT's Wikipedia and Book corpus models as well as on several fine-tuned General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) benchmarks. In addition, we evaluate the bias from several more extreme corpora including the Jigsaw identity toxic dataset that includes toxic speech biased against race, gender, religion, and disability and the RtGender dataset that includes speech specifically labelled by gender. Our results reveal that the direct gender bias of the Jigsaw toxic identity dataset is surprisingly close to that of the base pre-trained Google model, but the RtGender dataset has significantly higher direct gender bias than the base model. When the bias learned by an NLP system can vary significantly with the corpora used for training, it becomes important to consider and report these details, especially for use in critical decision-making applications.",,,978-1-4503-7024-0,752-759, , 29th World Wide Web Conference (WWW)29th World Wide Web Conference (WWW) ,

To address this problem, we initially propose the Dependency-aware Controllable Text Generation (DCTG) model that reduces trivial generations by automatically learning the co-occurrence dependencies and adjusting rarely co-occurring controlled values.

"Hu, Zhiting; Li, Li Erran",,,A Causal Lens for Controllable Text Generation,34,, ,Proceedings Paper ,2021,"Controllable text generation concerns two fundamental tasks of wide applications, namely generating text of given attributes (i.e., attribute-conditional generation), and minimally editing existing text to possess desired attributes (i.e., text attribute transfer). Extensive prior work has largely studied the two problems separately, and developed different conditional models which, however, are prone to producing biased text (e.g., various gender stereotypes). This paper proposes to formulate controllable text generation from a principled causal perspective which models the two tasks with a unified framework. A direct advantage of the causal formulation is the use of rich causality tools to mitigate generation biases and improve control. We treat the two tasks as interventional and counterfactual causal inference based on a structural causal model, respectively. We then apply the framework to the challenging practical setting where confounding factors (that induce spurious correlations) are observable only on a small fraction of data.

In recent years, methods using large-scale pre-trained language models (PLMs), in particular the widely used Transformer-based PLMs, have become a new paradigm of NLG, allowing generation of more diverse and fluent text. However, due to the limited level of interpretability of deep neural networks, the controllability of these methods needs to be guaranteed. To this end, controllable text generation using Transformer-based PLMs has become a rapidly growing yet challenging new research hotspot. A diverse range of approaches have emerged in the past 3 to 4 years, targeting different CTG tasks that require different types of controlled constraints.

More specifically, the previous DGAs are hard to satisfy domain name rules, low repetition rate, and anti-detection in practical scenarios simultaneously.

Many of the existing style transfer benchmarks primarily focus on individual high-level semantic changes (e.g. positive to negative), which enable controllability at a high level but do not offer fine-grained control involving sentence structure, emphasis, and content of the sentence. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale benchmark, STYLEPTB, with (1) paired sentences undergoing 21 fine-grained stylistic changes spanning atomic lexical, syntactic, semantic, and thematic transfers of text, as well as (2) compositions of multiple transfers which allow modeling of fine-grained stylistic changes as building blocks for more complex, high-level transfers. By benchmarking existing methods on STYLEPTB, we find that they struggle to model fine-grained changes and have an even more difficult time composing multiple styles. As a result, STYLEPTB brings novel challenges that we hope will encourage future research in controllable text style transfer, compositional models, and learning disentangled representations.

While applications like summarization and translation are positive, the underlying technology also might enable adversaries to generate neural fake news: targeted propaganda that closely mimics the style of real news.Modern computer security relies on careful threat modeling: identifying potential threats and vulnerabilities from an adversary's point of view, and exploring potential mitigations to these threats. Likewise, developing robust defenses against neural fake news requires us first to carefully investigate and characterize the risks of these models. We thus present a model for controllable text generation called Grover. Given a headline like 'Link Found Between Vaccines and Autism,' Grover can generate the rest of the article; humans find these generations to be more trustworthy than human-written disinformation.Developing robust verification techniques against generators like Grover is critical. We find that best current discriminators can classify neural fake news from real, human-written, news with 73% accuracy, assuming access to a moderate level of training data. Counterintuitively, the best defense against Grover turns out to be Grover itself, with 92% accuracy, demonstrating the importance of public release of strong generators. We investigate these results further, showing that exposure bias - and sampling strategies that alleviate its effects - both leave artifacts that similar discriminators can pick up on.

To make the generated essays of high quality, a reasonable method should consider both diversity and topic-consistency. Another essential issue is the intrinsic link of the topics, which contributes to making the essays closely surround the semantics of provided topics. However, it remains challenging for TEG to fill the semantic gap between source topic words and target output, and a more powerful model is needed to capture the semantics of given topics. To this end, we propose a pretraining-based contextual self-attention (PC-SAN) model that is built upon the seq2seq framework. For the encoder of our model, we employ a dynamic weight sum of layers from BERT to fully utilize the semantics of topics, which is of great help to fill the gap and improve the quality of the generated essays. In the decoding phase, we also transform the target-side contextual history information into the query layers to alleviate the lack of context in typical self-attention networks (SANs).

However, existing dialogue datasets do not provide enough annotation to explain and correct such unsafe behavior. In this work, we construct a new dataset called SAFECONV for the research of conversational safety: (1) Besides the utterance-level safety labels, SAFECONV also provides unsafe spans in an utterance, information able to indicate which words contribute to the detected unsafe behavior; (2) SAFECONV provides safe alternative responses to continue the conversation when unsafe behavior detected, guiding the conversation to a gentle trajectory. By virtue of the comprehensive annotation of SAFECONV, we benchmark three powerful models for the mitigation of conversational unsafe behavior, including a checker to detect unsafe utterances, a tagger to extract unsafe spans, and a rewriter to convert an unsafe response to a safe version. Moreover, we explore the huge benefits brought by combining the models for explaining the emergence of unsafe behavior and detoxifying chatbots. Experiments show that the detected unsafe behavior could be well explained with unsafe spans and popular chatbots could be detoxified by a huge extent.

We examine communities that use a block-list type bot to prevent harassment from the source of harassment. Drawing from social categorization and selective exposure theories, we theorize that employing a machine alongside humans for community moderation will create unintended adverse effects. Specifically, within the moderated focal community, we hypothesize an emboldening effect characterized by an increase in harassment among community members directed at their outgroup members. Additionally, we expect a disengaging effect, that is, a downward trend in the focal community's membership. Finally, in neighboring communities that share the same topic of discussion, we expect a spillover effect, that is, an increase in harassment. Employing Detoxify, a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)-based model, we evaluate harassment scores in the focal community by analyzing 4 million Reddit comments across various communities. These scores serve as inputs for Bayesian Structural Time Series analysis, revealing evidence for both disengaging and spillover effects. For the emboldening effect, we use community-specific keywords in a predefined computer-assisted document classification approach, Keyword Assisted Topic Model (keyATM), to identify the target of harassment.

However, their practical usability is often compromised by a propensity to generate toxic content, such as insults, threats, and profanity, particularly in response to adversarial prompts. Several fine-tuning and decoding approaches have been employed to address this challenge to mitigate toxicity. Nevertheless, these methods typically necessitate additional resources, such as high-quality training data or auxiliary models, thereby incurring extra costs. In this paper, we propose a novel detoxification framework, Fine-Grained Detoxification via Instance-Level Prefixes (FGDILP), which effectively mitigates the generation of toxic text without incurring additional training costs. Specifically, FGDILP leverages contextualized representations in attention space by contrasting a positive prefix-prepended prompt against multiple negative prefix-prepended prompts at the instance level. This methodology facilitates the construction of fine-grained subtoxicity vectors, which are subsequently fused to adjust the original generation pathway when responding to raw prompts. Our results demonstrate that FGDILP enables controlled text generation concerning detoxification at both the utterance and context levels. While our method slightly impacts generation fluency and diversity, it significantly outperforms prompt-based baselines regarding detoxification effectiveness.

Van der Waals and electrostatic interactions were the primary influencing factors, and significant differences in the types and proportions of the main amino acids in the interaction between ADs and receptors were observed.

Its prevalence intensifies during periods of social crises and unrest, eroding a sense of safety and community. Such toxic environments can adversely impact the mental well-being of those exposed and further deepen societal divisions and polarization. The 2022 mpox outbreak, initially called monkeypox but later renamed to reduce stigma and address societal concerns, provides a relevant context for this issue. Objective: In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the toxic online discourse surrounding the 2022 mpox outbreak. We aimed to dissect its origins, characterize its nature and content, trace its dissemination patterns, and assess its broader societal implications, with the goal of providing insights that can inform strategies to mitigate such toxicity in future crises. Methods: We collected >1.6 million unique tweets and analyzed them with 5 dimensions: context, extent, content, speaker, and intent. Using topic modeling based on bidirectional encoder representations from transformers and social network community clustering, we delineated the toxic dynamics on Twitter. Results: By categorizing topics, we identified 5 high-level categories in the toxic online discourse on Twitter, including disease (20,281/43,521, 46.6%), health policy and health care (8400/43,521, 19.3%), homophobia (10,402/43,521, 23.9%), politics (2611/43,521, 6%), and racism (1784/43,521, 4.1%). Across these categories, users displayed negativity or controversial views on the mpox outbreak, highlighting the escalating political tensions and the weaponization of stigma during this infodemic. Through the toxicity diffusion networks of mentions (17,437 vertices with 3628 clusters), retweets (59,749 vertices with 3015 clusters), and the top users with the highest in-degree centrality, we found that retweets of toxic content were widespread, while influential users rarely engaged with or countered this toxicity through retweets. Conclusions: Our study introduces a comprehensive workflow that combines topical and network analyses to decode emerging social issues during crises. By tracking topical dynamics, we can track the changing popularity of toxic content on the internet, providing a better understanding of societal challenges. Network dynamics highlight key social media influencers and their intentions, suggesting that engaging with these central figures in toxic discourse can improve crisis communication and guide policy making.",1438-8871,,,, ,  ,

While facilitating connectivity, these platforms have introduced challenges such as overcoming linguistic differences and preventing spam and offensive content diffusion. This is particularly pertinent in the context of deliberative events, where online platforms could be used to extend the inclusion of citizens in democratic decision-making. In traditional deliberative events, human moderators and translators were used to facilitate conversation; however, the need for these figures imposed a limit on both the number of deliberative events that could be organized and the number of participants. In response, this paper proposes an automated moderator for deliberative events. The moderator is developed in Python for the online communication platform Discord and can be used, thanks to the integrated AI (Artificial Intelligence) tools, to automatically manage conversation agendas, prevent spam and inappropriate language, analyze the sentiment of the conversation, and translate messages into multiple languages. In particular, three classifiers, based on a pre-trained BERT (Bidirection Encoder Representations from Transformers), were fine-tuned for spam detection, toxic comments classification, and sentiment analysis. These allow the moderator to automatically detect and remove spam and offensive messages in different languages, send warnings to users, alert administrators, and, after repeated warnings, impose bans. Additionally, a built-in translator, based on Meta's No Language Left Behind NLLB model, translates messages into five languages (Italian, English, French, German, and Polish). The developed bot was tested in a simulated deliberative event on a Discord server, demonstrating its ability to manage conversations and prevent linguistic abuse.",,2079-9292,,, ,  ,

General unsupervised methods were used depending on the state-of-art models and external embeddings to improve the accuracy while relieving bias and enhancing F1-score. Suggested approaches used a combination of long short-term memory (LSTM) deep learning model with Glove word embeddings and LSTM with word embeddings generated by the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), respectively.

In addition, manual sorting of kitchen waste is inefficient and toxic waste is harmful to human health, making automatic detection of kitchen waste technology crucial. Automatic detection of kitchen waste in complex scenes faces the challenge of diversity of category outlines and uneven distribution. In this paper, we propose a detector based on statistical adaptive modeling(namely SA-Det) for the automatic detection of kitchen waste in complex scenes. Firstly, to solve the issue of diversity of category outlines, we propose a category statistics adaptive (CSA) module. The CSA module constructs dynamic thresholds for each instance to accurately assign positive and negative samples by fusing category statistics and instance shape information, thereby improving detection performance. Moreover, to solve the issue of uneven distribution, we propose a distribution adaptive (DA) module, which dynamically adjusts the loss weights by adaptively sensing the number of labels during training process. Extensive experiments on our constructed kitchen waste dataset (KWD) demonstrate that SA-Det consistently and significantly improves the performance of existing state-of-the-art methods (e.g., Rotated_RetinaNet (Lin et al., 2017) and RoI_Transformer (Ding et al., 2019)) by around 2% to 3.5%.",1568-4946,1872-9681,,, ,  ,

Analyzing sentiment in gaming contexts is difficult due to the brevity of messages, the lack of context, and the use of informal language, which is exacerbated in the gaming environment by slang, abbreviations, memes, and jargon. First, a novel Spanish corpus was created from chat messages on Spanish video game Twitch channels, manually labeled for polarity and emotions. It is noteworthy as the first Spanish corpus for analyzing social responses on Twitch. Secondly, machine learning algorithms were used to classify polarity and emotions offering promising evaluations. The methodology followed in this work consists of three main steps: (1) Extracting Twitch chat messages from Spanish streamers' channels related to gaming events and gameplays; (2) Processing and selecting the messages to form the corpus and manually annotating polarity and emotions; and (3) Applying machine learning models to detect polarity and emotions in the created corpus. The results have shown that a Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT) based model excels with 78% accuracy in polarity detection, while deep learning and Random Forest models reach around 70%. For emotion detection, the BERT model performs best with 68%, followed by deep learning with 55%.

Instead of relying solely on automatic solutions, moderation of the most difficult and ambiguous cases can be delegated to human workers. Potential mistakes in automated classification can be identified by using uncertainty estimation (UE) techniques. Although UE is a rapidly growing field within natural language processing, we find that state-of-the-art UE methods estimate only epistemic uncertainty and show poor performance, or under-perform trivial methods for ambiguous tasks such as toxicity detection. We argue that in order to create robust uncertainty estimation methods for ambiguous tasks it is necessary to account also for aleatoric uncertainty.

However, safely deploying them in real world applications is challenging because they generate toxic content. To address this challenge, we propose two novel pretraining data augmentation strategies that significantly reduce model toxicity without compromising its utility. Our two strategies are: (1) MEDA: adds raw toxicity score as meta-data to the pretraining samples, and (2) INST: adds instructions to those samples indicating their toxicity. Our results indicate that our best performing strategy (INST) substantially reduces the toxicity probability up to 61% while preserving the accuracy on five benchmark NLP tasks as well as improving AUC scores on four bias detection tasks by 1.3%. We also demonstrate the generalizability of our techniques by scaling the number of training samples and the number of model parameters.",,,978-1-959429-44-9,2636-2651, , 17th Conference of the European-Chapter of the Association-for-Computational-Linguistics (EACL)17th Conference of the European-Chapter of the Association-for-Computational-Linguistics (EACL) ,

These machine learning systems follow an end-to-end data-driven learning paradigm and are trained on large conversational datasets. Imperfections or harmful biases in the training datasets can cause the models to learn toxic behavior, and thereby expose their users to harmful responses. Prior work has focused on measuring the inherent toxicity of such chatbots, by devising queries that are more likely to produce toxic responses. In this work, we ask the question: How easy or hard is it to inject toxicity into a chatbot after deployment? We study this in a practical scenario known as Dialog-based Learning (DBL), where a chatbot is periodically trained on recent conversations with its users after deployment. A DBL setting can be exploited to poison the training dataset for each training cycle. Our attacks would allow an adversary to manipulate the degree of toxicity in a model and also enable control over what type of queries can trigger a toxic response. Our fully automated attacks only require LLM-based software agents masquerading as (malicious) users to inject high levels of toxicity. We systematically explore the vulnerability of popular chatbot pipelines to this threat.

While these efforts are important, these models usually do not generalize well and they can not cope with new trends (e.g., the emergence of new toxic terms). Currently, we are witnessing a shift in the approach to tackling societal issues online, particularly leveraging large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 or T5 that are trained on vast corpora and have strong generalizability. In this work, we investigate how we can use LLMs and prompt learning to tackle the problem of toxic content, particularly focusing on three tasks; 1) Toxicity Classification, 2) Toxic Span Detection, and 3) Detoxification. We perform an extensive evaluation over five model architectures and eight datasets demonstrating that LLMs with prompt learning can achieve similar or even better performance compared to models trained on these specific tasks. We find that prompt learning achieves around 10% improvement in the toxicity classification task compared to the baselines, while for the toxic span detection task we find better performance to the best baseline (0.643 vs. 0.640 in terms of F-1-score).

We introduce Quantized Reward Konditioning (Quark), an algorithm for optimizing a reward function that quantifies an (un)wanted property, while not straying too far from the original model. Quark alternates between (i) collecting samples with the current language model, (ii) sorting them into quantiles based on reward, with each quantile identified by a reward token prepended to the language model's input, and (iii) using a standard language modeling loss on samples from each quantile conditioned on its reward token, while remaining nearby the original language model via a KL-divergence penalty. By conditioning on a high-reward token at generation time, the model generates text that exhibits less of the unwanted property.

These models require massive amounts of data and compute capacity to train, to the extent that concerns over the training data (such as protected or private content) cannot be practically addressed by retraining the model from scratch with the questionable data removed or altered. Furthermore, despite significant efforts and controls dedicated to ensuring that training corpora are properly curated and composed, the sheer volume required makes it infeasible to manually inspect each datum comprising a training corpus. One potential approach to training corpus data defects is model disgorgement, by which we broadly mean the elimination or reduction of not only any improperly used data, but also the effects of improperly used data on any component of an ML model. Model disgorgement techniques can be used to address a wide range of issues, such as reducing bias or toxicity, increasing fidelity, and ensuring responsible use of intellectual property. In this paper, we survey the landscape of model disgorgement methods and introduce a taxonomy of disgorgement techniques that are applicable to modern ML systems.

This study examined the effects of (the Korean translation of) two cues, speak with your big mouth and speak with your strong voice, on speech acoustics and intelligibility of Korean-speaking children with CP. Method: Fifteen Korean-speaking children with CP repeated words and sentences in habitual, big mouth, and strong voice conditions. Acoustic analyses were performed and intelligibility was assessed by means of 90 blinded listeners' ease-of-understanding (EoU) ratings and percentage of words correctly transcribed (PWC). Results: In response to both cues, children's vocal intensity and utterance duration increased significantly and differentially, whereas their vowel space area gains did not reach statistical significance. EoU increased significantly in the big mouth condition at word, but not sentence, level, whereas in the strong voice condition, EoU increased significantly at both levels. PWC increases were not statistically significant. Considerable variability in children's responses to cues was noted overall. Conclusions: Korean-speaking children with CP modify their speech styles differentially when provided with cues aimed to increase their articulatory working space and vocal intensity. The results provide preliminary support for the use of the strong voice cue, in particular, to increase EoU. While the findings do not offer conclusive evidence of the intelligibility benefits of these cues, investigation with a larger sample size should provide further insight into optimal cueing strategies for increasing intelligibility in this population.

In 2013, our group developed ToxinPred, a computational method that has been extensively adopted by the scientific community for predicting peptide toxicity. In this paper, we propose a refined variant of ToxinPred that showcases improved reliability and accuracy in predicting peptide toxicity. Initially, we utilized a similarity/alignment-based approach employing BLAST to predict toxic peptides, which yielded satisfactory accuracy; however, the method suffered from inadequate coverage. Subsequently, we employed a motif-based approach using MERCI software to uncover specific patterns or motifs that are exclusively observed in toxic peptides. The search for these motifs in peptides allowed us to predict toxic peptides with a high level of specificity with poor sensitivity. To overcome the coverage limitations, we developed alignment-free methods using machine/deep learning techniques to balance sensitivity and specificity of prediction. Deep learning model (ANN - LSTM with fixed sequence length) developed using one-hot encoding achieved a maximum AUROC of 0.93 with MCC of 0.71 on an independent dataset. Machine learning model (extra tree) developed using compositional features of peptides achieved a maximum AUROC of 0.95 with MCC of 0.78. We also developed large language models and achieved maximum AUC of 0.93 using ESM2-t33. Finally, we developed hybrid or ensemble methods combining two or more methods to enhance performance.

One promising approach to address this is to use discriminators to guide decoding from LMs, but existing methods for this are too slow to be useful in practice for many applications. We present GeDi as a significantly more efficient discriminator-based approach for guiding decoding. GeDi guides generation at each step by computing classification probabilities for all possible next tokens via Bayes rule by normalizing over two class-conditional distributions; one conditioned on the desired attribute, or control code, and another conditioned on the undesired attribute, or anti control code.

In this paper, we analyze all 57 million comments made on user talk pages of 8.5 million editors across the six most active language editions of Wikipedia to study the potential impact of toxicity on editors' behavior. We find that toxic comments are consistently associated with reduced activity of editors, equivalent to 0.5-2 active days per user in the short term. This translates to multiple human-years of lost productivity, considering the number of active contributors to Wikipedia.

Many approaches reduce this problem to training a predictor of the desired attribute. For example, researchers hoping to deploy a large language model to produce non-toxic content may use a toxicity classifier to filter generated text. In practice, the generated text to classify, which is determined by user prompts, may come from a wide range of distributions. In this paper, we show that the performance of controlled generation may be poor if the distributions of text in response to user prompts differ from the distribution the predictor was trained on. To address this problem, we cast controlled generation under distribution shift as an invariant learning problem: the most effective predictor should be invariant across multiple text environments.

Generative AI models have the potential to understand and detect harmful textual content.

Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)-where human preference judgments on LM outputs are transformed into a learning signal-has recently shown promise in addressing these issues. However, such holistic feedback conveys limited information on long text outputs; it does not indicate which aspects of the outputs influenced user preference; e.g., which parts contain what type(s) of errors. In this paper, we use fine-grained human feedback (e.g., which sentence is false, which sub-sentence is irrelevant) as an explicit training signal. We introduce FINE-GRAINED RLHF, a framework that enables training and learning from reward functions that are fine-grained in two respects: (1) density, providing a reward after every segment (e.g., a sentence) is generated; and (2) incorporating multiple reward models associated with different feedback types (e.g., factual incorrectness, irrelevance, and information incompleteness). We conduct experiments on detoxification and long-form question answering to illustrate how learning with such reward functions leads to improved performance, supported by both automatic and human evaluation.

Wallace's apparent paradox can be dissolved with two hypotheses about human cognition. One is that intelligence is an adaptation to a knowledge-using, socially interdependent lifestyle, the cognitive niche. This embraces the ability to overcome the evolutionary fixed defenses of plants and animals by applications of reasoning, including weapons, traps, coordinated driving of game, and detoxification of plants. Such reasoning exploits intuitive theories about different aspects of the world, such as objects, forces, paths, places, states, substances, and other people's beliefs and desires. The theory explains many zoologically unusual traits in Homo sapiens, including our complex toolkit, wide range of habitats and diets, extended childhoods and long lives, hypersociality, complex mating, division into cultures, and language (which multiplies the benefit of knowledge because know-how is useful not only for its practical benefits but as a trade good with others, enhancing the evolution of cooperation). The second hypothesis is that humans possess an ability of metaphorical abstraction, which allows them to coopt faculties that originally evolved for physical problem-solving and social coordination, apply them to abstract subject matter, and combine them productively. These abilities can help explain the emergence of abstract cognition without supernatural or exotic evolutionary forces and are in principle testable by analyses of statistical signs of selection in the human genome.",0027-8424,,,8993-8999, ,  ,

Characterization of the chloroplast proteome dynamics can contribute to a better understanding on plant adaptation to different climate scenarios and leaf development processes. Herein, we carried out a discovery-driven analysis of the Eucalyptus grandis chloroplast proteome during leaf maturation and throughout different seasons of the year. The chloroplast proteome from young leaves differed the most from all assessed samples. Most upregulated proteins identified in mature and young leaves were those related to catabolic-redox signaling and biogenesis processes, respectively. Seasonal dynamics revealed unique proteome features in the fall and spring periods. The most abundant chloroplast protein in humid (wet) seasons (spring and summer) was a small subunit of RuBisCO, while in the dry periods (fall and winter) the proteins that showed the most pronounced accumulation were associated with photo-oxidative damage, Calvin cycle, shikimate pathway, and detoxification. Our investigation of the chloroplast proteome dynamics during leaf development revealed significant alterations in relation to the maturation event. Our findings also suggest that transition seasons induced the most pronounced chloroplast proteome changes over the year.

The mosquito Anopheles aquasalis is an important vector of Plasmodium vivax, the main human malaria parasite in the Americas. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been shown to have a role in insect innate immune responses as a potent pathogen-killing agent. We investigated the mechanisms of free radicals modulation after A. aquasalis infection with P. vivax. ROS metabolism was evaluated in the vector by studying expression and activity of three key detoxification enzymes, one catalase and two superoxide dismutases (SOD3A and SOD3B). Also, the involvement of free radicals in the mosquito immunity was measured by silencing the catalase gene followed by infection of A. aquasalis with P. vivax. Catalase, SOD3A and SOD3B expression in whole A. aquasalis were at the same levels of controls at 24 h and upregulated 36 h after ingestion of blood containing P. vivax. However, in the insect isolated midgut, the mRNA for these enzymes was not regulated by P. vivax infection, while catalase activity was reduced 24 h after the infectious meal. RNAi-mediated silencing of catalase reduced enzyme activity in the midgut, resulted in increased P. vivax infection and prevalence, and decreased bacterial load in the mosquito midgut. Our findings suggest that the interactions between A. aquasalis and P. vivax do not follow the model of ROS-induced parasite killing. It appears that P. vivax manipulates the mosquito detoxification system in order to allow its own development. This can be an indirect effect of fewer competitive bacteria present in the mosquito midgut caused by the increase of ROS after catalase silencing. These findings provide novel information on unique aspects of the main malaria parasite in the Americas interaction with one of its natural vectors.",1932-6203,,,, ,  ,

Therefore, we sampled 3rd instar larvae and soil from sites with high and low infestation rates to analyze the microbiome using next-generation sequencing. We analyzed twenty-four 16S DNA libraries, which resulted in 3278 operational taxonomic units. The alpha and beta diversity of the soil microbiome was similar between sites. In contrast, the larvae from high-density sites presented a higher bacterial gut diversity than larvae from low-density sites, with biomarkers linked to plant digestion, nutrient acquisition, and detoxification. Consequently, larvae from high-density sites displayed several enriched molecular functions associated with the families Ruminococcaceae, Clostridiaceae and Rikenellaceae. These bacteria revealed a supportive function by producing several CAZyme families and other proteins.

Proteomic analyses of the secretome of M. palmivorus show that laccases are the most predominant enzyme released by this fungus. The whole crude enzymatic broth is used for the delignification of lignin in Eucalyptus globulus wood, with the aim of enhancing the saccharification by cellulolytic and xylanolytic enzymes from Penicillium echinulatum S1M29.

The E. globulus wood delignification results in a 31% decrease in the lignin content and a 10% increase in the glucose yield after hydrolysis. An important finding of the present work is the successful wood delignification in the absence of laccase mediators. This laccase-rich preparation also demonstrates its potential in removing the phenolic inhibitors present in steam-exploded E. globulus wood, increasing the ethanol yield by an additional 10%. Furthermore, it is important to highlight that these findings are achieved in the absence of commercial enzymes, making M. palmivorus laccases a potential candidate not only for the production of biofuels but also for the generation of lignin-derived aromatic compounds for different applications in the biotechnology industry.",0306-2619,1872-9118,,, ,  ,

In Brazil, sugarcane bagasse has been proposed as the lignocellulosic residue for this biofuel production. The enzymatic cocktails for the degradation of biomass-derived polysaccharides are mostly produced by fungi, such as Aspergillus niger and Trichoderma reesei. However, it is not yet fully understood how these microorganisms degrade plant biomass. In order to identify transcriptomic changes during steam-exploded bagasse (SEB) breakdown, we conducted a RNA-seq comparative transcriptome profiling of both fungi growing on SEB as carbon source.Results: Particular attention was focused on CAZymes, sugar transporters, transcription factors (TFs) and other proteins related to lignocellulose degradation. Although genes coding for the main enzymes involved in biomass deconstruction were expressed by both fungal strains since the beginning of the growth in SEB, significant differences were found in their expression profiles. The expression of these enzymes is mainly regulated at the transcription level, and A. niger and T. reesei also showed differences in TFs content and in their expression. Several sugar transporters that were induced in both fungal strains could be new players on biomass degradation besides their role in sugar uptake. Interestingly, our findings revealed that in both strains several genes that code for proteins of unknown function and pro-oxidant, antioxidant, and detoxification enzymes were induced during growth in SEB as carbon source, but their specific roles on lignocellulose degradation remain to be elucidated.Conclusions: This is the first report of a time-course experiment monitoring the degradation of pretreated bagasse by two important fungi using the RNA-seq technology.

The sea rush Juncus maritimus and the sea-club rush Scirpus maritimus, both from the lower Douro river estuary (NW Portugal), were used. Plants were collected seasonally, four times a year in 2004, during low tide. After sampling, plant roots were washed for removal of adherent particles and immersed for 2 h in a solution that matched salinity (3) and pH (7.5) of the pore water from the same location and spiked with Cu2+ in the range 0-1600 nM to obtain plant exudates. In the final solutions as well as in sediment pore water total dissolved Zn and Cu, Cu-complexing ligand concentrations and the respective conditional stability constants (k'(CuL)) values were determined by voltammetry. This study demonstrated that plants are able to release, in a short period of time, relatively high amounts of strong Cu-complexing ligands (56-265 nmol g(root)(-1)), which differed among plants and sampling site but were independent of the season. Cu contamination did not stimulate exudation of Cu-complexing ligands. On the other hand, in media contaminated with Cu both plants accumulated relatively high amounts (29-83%) of the initially dissolved Cu, indicating that they have alternative internal mechanisms for Cu detoxification. Cu exchange between roots and medium (either accumulation in contaminated medium or release in the absence of Cu) was more intense for S. maritimus than for J. maritimus. It was observed that exudate solutions obtained in the absence of added Cu and sediment pore water (the densities of roots observed inside the salt marsh where comparable to those used in the in vitro experiments), displayed similarities in terms of total dissolved metals, Cu-complexing ligands concentrations, values of k'(CuL) (12 < 109 K'(CuL) < 14), as well as patterns of variation among seasons (only observed for Zn). These results are novel and point out that salt marsh plants may be the source at least partially of the strong organic ligands found in the sediment pore water in shallow marginal areas. The capability of salt marsh plants to release strong organic ligands into the environment, conjugated with their known capacity to oxidize anaerobic sediment around roots, indicate that these plants can play a role in controlling metal speciation in the water/sediment interface.

To address this problem, a method for hard- constrained controllable text generation based on latent variables improving on weak correlations is proposed. The method utilizes latent variables to capture both global and local constraint correlation information to guide the language model to generate hard-constrained controllable text at the macro and micro levels, respectively. The introduction of latent variables not only reveals the latent correlation between constraints, but also helps the model to precisely satisfy these constraints while maintaining semantic coherence and logical correctness.

For example, in a customer service conversation, responses from the agent should ideally be soothing and address the user's dissatisfaction or complaints. This imposes significant demands on controlling language model output. However, demerits exist among traditional methods. Promoting and fine-tuning language models exhibit the hallucination phenomenon and cannot guarantee complete adherence to constraints. Conditional language models (CLM), which map control codes into LM representations or latent space, require training the modified language models from scratch and a high amount of customized dataset is demanded. Decoding-time methods employ Bayesian Rules to modify the output of the LM or model constraints as a combination of energy functions and update the output along the low-energy direction. Both methods are confronted with the efficiency sampling problem. Moreover, there are no methods that consider the relation between constraints weights and the contexts, as is essential in actual applications such as customer service scenarios. To alleviate the problems mentioned above, we propose Controllable Text Generation with Generative Adversarial Networks (CTGGAN), which utilizes a language model with logits bias as the Generator to produce constrained text and employs the Discriminator with learnable constraint weight combinations to score and update the generation. We evaluate the method in the text completion task and Chinese customer service dialogues scenario, and our method shows superior performance in metrics such as PPL and Dist-3.

Thus, we can perform sophisticated and flexible controls in the prior space and feed the control effects back into the latent space owing to the bijection property of invertible transformations.

In this work, we provide a theoretical lower bound for the interference and empirically found that the interference grows with the number of layers where prefixes are inserted. Based on these analyses, we propose using trainable gates to normalize the intervention of prefixes to restrain the growing interference. As a result, controlling training-time unseen combinations of aspects can be realized by simply concatenating corresponding plugins such that new constraints can be extended at a lower cost.

To this end, we propose a memory-enhanced transfer method, which learns fine-grained style representation concerning content to assist transfer. Rather than employing static style embedding or latent variables, our method abstracts linguistic characteristics from training corpora and memorizes subdivided content with the corresponding style representations. The style signal is dynamically retrieved from memory using the content as a query, providing a more expressive and flexible latent style space. To address the imbalance between quantity and quality in different content, we further introduce a calibration method to augment memory construction by modeling the relationship between candidate styles.

Theoretically, we show that DuNST can be viewed as enhancing the exploration of the potentially larger real text space while maintaining exploitation, guaranteeing improved performance. Experiments on three controllable generation tasks show that DuNST significantly boosts control accuracy with comparable generation fluency and diversity against several strong baselines.",,,978-1-959429-72-2,8760-8785, , 61st Annual Meeting of the the Association-for-Computational-Linguistics (ACL)61st Annual Meeting of the the Association-for-Computational-Linguistics (ACL) ,

We find that, after training, sense vectors specialize, each encoding a different aspect of a word. We can interpret a sense vector by inspecting its (non-contextual, linear) projection onto the output space, and intervene on these interpretable hooks to change the model's behavior in predictable ways. We train a 170M-parameter Backpack language model on OpenWebText, matching the loss of a GPT-2 small (124M-parameter) Transformer.

While most approaches for conditional text generation have primarily focused on lexical constraints, they often struggle to effectively incorporate syntactic constraints, which provide a richer language for approximating semantic constraints. We address this gap by introducing NEUROSTRUCTURAL DECODING, a new decoding algorithm that incorporates syntactic constraints to further improve the quality of the generated text. We build NEUROSTRUCTURAL DECODING on the NeuroLogic Decoding (Lu et al., 2021b) algorithm, which enables language generation models to produce fluent text while satisfying complex lexical constraints. Our algorithm is powerful and scalable. It tracks lexico-syntactic constraints (e.g., we need to observe dog as subject and ball as object) during decoding by parsing the partial generations at each step. To this end, we adapt a dependency parser to generate parses for incomplete sentences. Our approach is evaluated on three different language generation tasks, and the results show improved performance in both lexical and syntactic metrics compared to previous methods. The results suggest this is a promising solution for integrating fine-grained controllable text generation into the conventional beam search decoding(1).",,,978-1-959429-72-2,9496-9510, , 61st Annual Meeting of the the Association-for-Computational-Linguistics (ACL)61st Annual Meeting of the the Association-for-Computational-Linguistics (ACL) ,

While manipulating prompt formats could improve outputs, designing specific and precise prompts per task can be challenging and ineffective. To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel inference method, Prompt Highlighter, which enables users to highlight specific prompt spans to interactively control the focus during generation. Motivated by the classifier-free diffusion guidance, we form regular and unconditional context pairs based on highlighted tokens, demonstrating that the autoregressive generation in models can be guided in a classifier-free way. Notably, we find that, during inference, guiding the models with highlighted tokens through the attention weights leads to more desired outputs.

Second, generating pseudo text in each iteration is time-consuming, severely decelerating the training process. In this work, we propose KEST, a novel and efficient self-training framework to handle these problems. KEST utilizes a kernel-based loss, rather than standard cross entropy, to learn from the soft pseudo text produced by a shared non-autoregressive generator. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that KEST can benefit from more diverse pseudo text in an efficient manner, which allows not only refining and exploiting the previously fitted distribution but also enhanced exploration towards a larger potential text space, providing a guarantee of improved performance.

In this paper, we pioneer the use of the Diffusion model for generating sonnets and Chinese SongCi poetry to tackle such challenges. In terms of semantics, our Poetry-Diffusion model, built upon the Diffusion model, generates entire sentences or poetry by comprehensively considering the entirety of sentence information. This approach enhances semantic expression, distinguishing it from autoregressive and large language models (LLMs). For metrical control, its constraint control module which can be trained individually enables us to flexibly incorporate a novel metrical controller to manipulate and evaluate metrics (format and rhythm). The denoising process in PoetryDiffusion allows for the gradual enhancement of semantics and flexible integration of the metrical controller which can calculate and impose penalties on states that stray significantly from the target control distribution.

However, it becomes more challenging when faced with a scarcity of paired data and labeling information. Existing disentangled methods crucially rely on oversimplified assumptions, such as assuming independent content and style variables, to identify the latent variables, even though such assumptions may not hold for complex data distributions. For instance, food reviews tend to involve words like tasty, whereas movie reviews commonly contain words such as thrilling for the same positive sentiment.

In this work, we tackle the domain-varying dependence between the content and the style variables inherent in the counterfactual generation task.

(2) An end-to-end morphological vision transformer network (Franchi et al 2020 Pattern Recognit. 102 107246, Ranem et al 2022 IEEE/CVF Conf. on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW) pp 3710-3719) is used to perform substructures segmentation within the hippocampus VOI. The substructures include the anterior and posterior regions of the hippocampus, which are defined as the hippocampus proper and parts of the subiculum. The vision transformer incorporates the dominant features extracted from MR images, which are further improved by learning-based morphological operators. The integration of these morphological operators into the vision transformer increases the accuracy and ability to separate hippocampus structure into its two distinct substructures. A total of 260 T1w MRI datasets from medical segmentation decathlon dataset were used in this study. We conducted a five-fold cross-validation on the first 200 T1w MR images and then performed a hold-out test on the remaining 60 T1w MR images with the model trained on the first 200 images. In five-fold cross-validation, the Dice similarity coefficients were 0.900 +/- 0.029 and 0.886 +/- 0.031 for the hippocampus proper and parts of the subiculum, respectively. The mean surface distances (MSDs) were 0.426 +/- 0.115 mm and 0.401 +/- 0.100 mm for the hippocampus proper and parts of the subiculum, respectively. The proposed method showed great promise in automatically delineating hippocampus substructures on T1w MR images. It may facilitate the current clinical workflow and reduce the physicians' effort.",0031-9155,1361-6560,,, ,  ,

For the first phase of abusive speech detection, Baseline models like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest and Decision Tree were trained and analyzed. Next, state-of-the-art models like LSTMs, Bi-LSTMs and Transformers were trained for classification of text.

However, therapeutic peptides used in medical treatment must exhibit low toxicity to red blood cells to achieve the desired therapeutic effect. Therefore, accurate prediction of the hemolytic activity of therapeutic peptides is essential for the development of peptide therapies. In this study, a multi-feature cross-fusion model, HemoFuse, for hemolytic peptide identification is proposed. The feature vectors of peptide sequences are transformed by word embedding technique and four hand-crafted feature extraction methods. We apply multi-head cross-attention mechanism to hemolytic peptide identification for the first time. It captures the interaction between word embedding features and hand-crafted features by calculating the attention of all positions in them, so that multiple features can be deeply fused.

However, the complexity of the data generated by this technology has limited the development of effective computational tools to identify and quantify cell processes.

Live-cell imaging enabled the study of apoptosis at the cellular level, enhancing our understanding of its spatial-temporal regulation. However, at present, no computational method can deliver robust detection of apoptosis in microscopy timelapses. To overcome this limitation, we developed ADeS, a deep learning-based apoptosis detection system that employs the principle of activity recognition. We trained ADeS on extensive datasets containing more than 10,000 apoptotic instances collected both in vitro and in vivo, achieving a classification accuracy above 98% and outperforming state-of-the-art solutions. ADeS is the first method capable of detecting the location and duration of multiple apoptotic events in full microscopy timelapses, surpassing human performance in the same task. We demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of ADeS across various imaging modalities, cell types, and staining techniques. Finally, we employed ADeS to quantify cell survival in vitro and tissue damage in mice, demonstrating its potential application in toxicity assays, treatment evaluation, and inflammatory dynamics.

The early symptom of fluoride toxicity is dental fluorosis. In severe cases of poisoning, it can lead to skeletal fluorosis. Screening for fluorosis is conducted almost yearly in remote fluorosis areas, but the lack of medical resources often leads to misdiagnosis or missed diagnosis. Therefore, applying deep learning technology to diagnose dental fluorosis is significant. Through field research and literature review, we discovered that the current screening for dental fluorosis relies entirely on doctors' knowledge and experience without applying deep learning in relevant studies on automated diagnosis. Based on the analysis of images, we noted that the lesions display irregular shapes and indistinct borders. Additionally, the appearance of lesions can be influenced by various factors, such as extrinsic staining and illuminance. They present challenges in diagnosing dental fluorosis. So, we proposed a two -stage methodology for grading the diagnosis of dental fluorosis. In the first stage, we proposed an improved U -Net based on large kernel convolution for tooth region segmentation. Additionally, we designed a pixel -association iterative algorithm to optimize the segmentation results. In the second stage, we devised a dual -branch fusion classifier based on CNN and Transformer, which ensured accurate classification even when the lesion features occupy only a tiny proportion of the entire image. We established the first dental fluorosis dataset and evaluated our proposed method, which has achieved satisfactory results in the grading diagnosis of dental fluorosis after conducting many experiments.

In short, the proposed Tailor represents each attribute as a pre-trained continuous vector (i.e., single-attribute prompt), which guides the generation of a fixed pre-trained language model (PLM) to satisfy a pre-specified attribute. These prompts can be simply concatenated as a whole for multi-attribute CTG without any re-training. Nevertheless, this may raise problems of fluency downgrading and position sensitivity. To solve this, Tailor provides two solutions to enhance the combination. The former contains a multi-attribute prompt mask and a re-indexing position sequence to bridge the gap between the training (one singleattribute prompt for each task) and the testing stage (concatenating two prompts). The latter introduces a trainable prompt connector to further enhance the combinations.

The model generates translation containing secret messages based on the neural machine translation model with semantic fusion and language model reference units. In this way, the semantics and contexts of translation are controlled by the additional semantic and contextual features acquired from the text to be translated. Also, a new encoding that combines arithmetic coding with a waiting mechanism is proposed in our model.

This paper introduces sketch-guided constrained decoding (SketchGCD), a novel approach to constrained decoding for blackbox LLMs, which operates without access to the logits of the blackbox LLM. SketchGCD utilizes a locally hosted auxiliary model to refine the output of an unconstrained blackbox LLM, effectively treating this initial output as a sketch for further elaboration. This approach is complementary to traditional logit-based techniques and enables the application of constrained decoding in settings where full model transparency is unavailable. We demonstrate the efficacy of SketchGCD through experiments in closed information extraction and constituency parsing, showing how it enhances the utility and flexibility of blackbox LLMs for complex NLP tasks.(1)",,,979-8-89176-095-0,234-245, , 62nd Annual Meeting of the Association-for-Computational-Linguistics (ACL) / Student Research Workshop (SRW)62nd Annual Meeting of the Association-for-Computational-Linguistics (ACL) / Student Research Workshop (SRW) ,

For AI specifically, we are seeing a new era of AI-assisted journalism emerge with trust in the AI-driven analyses and accuracy of results as core tenets.In Part I of this position paper, we discuss the contributions of six recently published research papers co-authored by Bloomberg's Artificial Intelligence Engineering team that show the intricacies of training AI models for reliable newsgathering processes. The papers investigate (a) the creation of models for updated headline generation, showing that headline generation models benefit from access to the past state of the article, (b) sequentially controlled text generation, which is a novel task and we show that in general, more structured awareness results in higher control accuracy and grammatical coherence, (c) chart summarization, which looks into identifying the key message and generating sentences that describe salient information in the multimodal documents, (d) a semistructured natural language inference task to develop a framework for data augmentation for tabular inference, (e) the introduction of a human-annotated dataset (ENTSUM) for controllable summarization with a focus on named entities as the aspect to control, and (f) a novel defense mechanism against adversarial attacks (ATINTER). We also examine Bloomberg's research work, building its own internal, not-for-commercial-use large language model, BloombergGPT, and training it with the goal of demonstrating support for a wide range of tasks within the financial industry.In Part II, we analyze the evolution of automation tasks in the Bloomberg newsroom that led to the creation of Bloomberg's News Innovation Lab. Technology-assisted content creation has been a reality at Bloomberg News for nearly a decade and has evolved from rules-based headline generation from structured files to the constant exploration of potential ways to assist story creation and storytelling in the financial domain. The Lab now oversees the operation of hundreds of software bots that create semi- and fully automated stories of financial relevance, providing journalists with depth in terms of data and analysis, speed in terms of reacting to breaking news, and transparency to corners of the financial world where data investigation is a gigantic undertaking. The Lab recently introduced new tools that provide journalists with the ability to explore automation on demand while it continues to experiment with ways to assist story production.In Part III, we conceptually discuss the transformative impact that generative AI can have in any newsroom, along with considerations about the technology's shortcomings in its current state of development. As with any revolutionary new technology, as well as with exciting research opportunities, part of the challenge is balancing any potential positive and negative impacts on society. We offer our principles and guidelines used to inform our approach to experimenting with the new generative AI technologies. Bloomberg News' style guide reminds us that our journalism is aimed at possibly the most sophisticated audience in the world, for whom accuracy is essential.",0738-4602,2371-9621,,187-199, ,  ,

In this research, we design two metrics to identify toxic user types: F score that captures the changes in a user's toxicity, and G score that captures the direction of the shift taking place in the user's toxicity pattern. We apply these metrics to a dataset of 4M user comments from Reddit by defining four toxic user types based on the toxicity scores of a user's comments: (a) Steady Users whose toxicity scores are steady over time, (b) Fickle-Minded Users that switch between toxic and non-toxic commenting, (c) Pacified Users whose commenting becomes less toxic in time, and (d) Radicalized Users that become gradually toxic. Findings from the Reddit dataset indicate that fickle-minded users form the largest group (31.2%), followed by pacified (25.8%), radicalized (25.4%), and steadily toxic users (17.6%). The results suggest that the most typical behavior type of toxicity is switching between toxic and non-toxic commenting. This research has implications for preserving the user-friendliness of online communities by identifying continuously toxic users and users in danger of becoming radicalized (in terms of their toxic behavior), and designing interventions to mitigate these behavior types. Using the metrics we have defined, identifying these user types becomes possible.

Understanding the spread of hate is crucial for mitigating its harmful effects and fostering a healthier online environment. In this paper, we propose a new model to capture the evolution of toxicity in a network - if a tweet with a certain toxicity (hatefulness) is posted, how much toxic a social network will become after a given number of rounds. We compute a toxicity score for each tweet, indicating the extent of the hatefulness of that tweet.Toxicity spread has not been adequately addressed in the existing literature. The two popular paradigms for modelling information spread, namely the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) and its variants, as well as the spreading-activation models (SPA), are not suitable for modelling toxicity spread. The first paradigm employs a threshold and categorizes tweets as either toxic or non-toxic, while the second paradigm treats hate as energy and applies energy-conversion principles to model its propagation. Through analysis of a Twitter dataset consisting of 19.58 million tweets, we observe that the total toxicity, as well as the average toxicity of original tweets and retweets in the network, does not remain constant but rather increases over time.In this paper, we propose a new method for toxicity spread. First, we categorize users into three distinct groups: Amplifiers, Attenuators, and Copycats. These categories are assigned based on the exchange of toxicity by a user, with Amplifiers sending out more toxicity than they receive, Attenuators experiencing a higher influx of toxicity compared to what they generate, and Copycats simply mirroring the hate they receive.

When uranium-exposed algae are ingested by fish, uranium tends to concentrate in the intestinal system and bones of fish. Comparatively, direct water uranium exposure resulted in a remarkable uranium accumulation in the head, skin, and muscles of fish, suggesting different toxicity depending on distinct exposure pathways. High-level uranium pollution (20 mg L-1 ) intensifies the toxicity to fish through food intake compared to direct water exposure.

In this paper, we design a new attack, ToxicChat, by fine-tuning a chatbot to engage in conversation with a target open-domain chatbot. The chatbot is fine-tuned with a collection of crafted conversation sequences. Particularly, each conversation begins with a sentence from a crafted prompt sentences dataset. Our extensive evaluation shows that open-domain chatbot models can be triggered to generate toxic responses in a multi-turn conversation. In the best scenario, ToxicChat achieves a 67% toxicity activation rate. The conversation sequences in the fine-tuning stage help trigger the toxicity in a conversation, which allows the attack to bypass two defense methods.

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the impact of foliar-applied silicon nanoparticles (SiNPs) at the tillering stage on the activation of physiological and antioxidant regulation in wheat to induce tolerance against varying As toxicity levels. The trial comprised two promising wheat cultivars (Anaaj and Ghazi) and five SiNPs regimes including 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 ppm doses against As toxicity levels of 0 and 25 ppm. The recorded findings depicted that SiNPs regimes significantly improved morphological characteristics such as root length, fresh and dry weight, as well as shoot length, and fresh and dry weight of wheat cultivars. Additionally, the levels of chlorophyll pigments, including chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and total chlorophyll contents, were significantly increased in SiNPs-treated plants, indicating improved photosynthetic activity. The enhanced antioxidant enzyme activities, such as ascorbate peroxidase (APX), superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT), played a vital role in combating oxidative stress induced by As toxicity. Moreover, SiNPs application resulted in a significant reduction in As concentration in both leaves and roots, highlighting the ability of SiNPs to regulate the uptake and accumulation of arsenic and mitigate its toxic effects. In conclusion, the foliar application of SiNPs during the tillering stage of wheat effectively activated physiological and antioxidant regulation, leading to enhanced tolerance against As toxicity.",1876-990X,1876-9918,,5199-5211, ,  ,

In this context, probiotics emerged as a potential tool since they promote organism welfare. Using a multidisciplinary approach, this study explores the effects of SLAB51 dietary administration to counteract BPA toxicity using zebrafish as a model. Adult males and females were maintained under standard conditions (control group; C), exposed for 28 days via the water to an environmental relevant dose of BPA (10 mu g/L; BPA), dietary treated with SLAB51 (109 CFU/g of body weight; P) and co -treated with BPA plus SLAB51 (BPA + P). In the gut, exposure to BPA resulted in altered architecture in both males and females, with females also experiencing an increase of pathogenic bacterial species. Co -administration of BPA + P led to the restoration of normal gut architecture, favored beneficial bacteria colonization, and decreased the abundance of pathogenic species. In the liver, male BPA exposure led to steatosis and glycogen depletion, which was partially mitigated by SLAB51 co -administration. In contrast, in females exposed to BPA, the lack of steatosis along with the greater glycogen depletion, suggested an increase in energy demand as supported by the metabolomic phenotype. The analysis of liver metabolites in BPA + P males revealed increased levels of anserine and reduced levels of glutamine, which could lie behind the counteraction of the brain histopathological damage caused by BPA. In BPA + P females, a reduction of retinoic acid was found in the liver, suggesting an increase in retinoids responsible for BPA detoxification. Overall, these results demonstrate that SLAB51 exerts its beneficial effects on the gut microbiota-brain-liver axis through distinct molecular pathways, effectively mitigating the pleiotropic toxicity of BPA.",0048-9697,1879-1026,,, ,  ,

PoDyP4 was demonstrated that the ability to almost completely degrade ZEN at pH 6.0 and 40 degrees C for 2 h, even at high concentrations of 1 mM. The promotion of enzymatic degradation of ZEN was most pronounced in the presence of Mg2+, while Cu2+ and Fe2+ exhibited a notable inhibitory effect. The degradation mechanism elucidated the detoxification of ZEN by PoDyP4 through hy-droxylation and polymerization reactions. The resulting metabolic products displayed significantly reduced toxicity and minimal impact on the viability and apoptosis of mouse spermatocytes GC-2 cells, in comparison to the original ZEN. Hydrophobic contacts and hydrogen bonds were found to be crucial for ZEN-PoDyP4 stability via molecular docking.

Deoxynivalenol (DON) which is also referred to as vomitoxin is a mycotoxin produced from many Fusarium species. DON ranks high among the prominent mycotoxins in cereal products and is a ubiquitous toxin in livestock feeds. DON's adverse effects present major health challenges in both livestock and humans. The use of natural sorbents including smectite clays, is an economically feasible strategy to mitigate mycotoxin toxicities. Previous studies have demonstrated the potential of edible clays as protective components of human food and animal feed to alleviate toxicity associated with short-term exposure to mycotoxins including DON. Hence, this study was designed to investigate the sorption mechanisms of DON onto the binding surfaces of beidellite clay, assessing essential binding parameters such as enthalpy, free energy, binding capacity, affinity, and plateau surface density. These markers were used to predict availability of DON under the experimental conditions. Furthermore, the protection of beidellite clay against DON-induced toxicity was carried out using living organisms susceptible to DON toxicity, including Hydra vulgaris and Lemna minor. These studies investigated the dose-dependent detoxification of DON by 0.05e2 % inclusion of beidellite. Beidellite exhibited more than 75 % protection in Lemna minor and 53 % in Hydra vulgaris validating that this clay is effective in detoxifying DON. During emergencies, or after disasters, inclusion of edible clay like beidellite in food, water or capsules could reduce bioavailability of DON and halt potential exposures to humans and animals.

This study demonstrates the cardioprotective bene fits of FLASH proton RT (F-PRT) compared with standard (conventional) proton RT (S-PRT), as evidenced by reduced acute and chronic cardiac toxicities. Methods and Materials: Mice were imaged using cone beam computed tomography to precisely determine the heart ' s apex as the beam isocenter. Irradiation was conducted using a shoot -through technique with a 5 -mm diameter circular collimator. Bulk RNA -sequencing was performed on nonirradiated samples, as well as apexes treated with F-PRT or S-PRT, at 2 weeks after a single 40 Gy dose. In flammatory responses were assessed through multiplex cytokine/chemokine microbead assay and immunofluorescence analyses. Levels of perivascular fibrosis were quantified using Masson ' s Trichrome and Picrosirius red staining. Additionally, cardiac tissue functionality was evaluated by 2 -dimensional echocardiograms at 8- and 30 -weeks post-PRT. Results: Radiation damage was specifically localized to the heart ' s apex. RNA pro fi ling of cardiac tissues treated with PRT revealed that S-PRT uniquely upregulated pathways associated with DNA damage response, induction of tumor necrosis factor superfamily, and in flammatory response, and F-PRT primarily affected cytoplasmic translation, mitochondrion organization, and adenosine triphosphate synthesis. Notably, F-PRT led to a milder in fl ammatory response, accompanied by signi fi cantly attenuated changes in transforming growth factor 0 1 and a smooth muscle actin levels. Critically, F-PRT decreased collagen deposition and better preserved cardiac functionality compared with S-PRT. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that F-PRT reduces the induction of an in flammatory environment with lower expression of in flammatory cytokines and pro fibrotic factors. Importantly, the results indicate that F-PRT better preserves cardiac functionality, as con firmed by echocardiography analysis, while also mitigating the development of long-term fibrosis.

While Se deficiency affects over a billion people worldwide, excessive Se levels can be toxic, presenting substantial risks to ecosystem health and public safety. The delicate balance between Se's beneficial and harmful effects necessitates a deeper understanding of its speciation dynamics and how different organisms within ecosystems respond to Se. Since humans primarily consume Se through Se-rich foods, exploring Se's behavior, uptake, and transport within agroecosystems is critical to creating effective management strategies. Traditional physicochemical methods for Se remediation are often expensive and potentially harmful to the environment, pushing the need for more sustainable solutions. In recent years, phytotechnologies have gained traction as a promising approach to Se management by harnessing plants' natural abilities to absorb, accumulate, metabolize, and volatilize Se. These strategies range from boosting Se uptake and tolerance in plants to releasing Se as less toxic volatile compounds or utilizing it as a biofortified supplement, opening up diverse possibilities for managing Se, offering sustainable pathways to improve crop nutritional quality, and protecting human health in different environmental contexts. However, closing the gaps in our understanding of Se dynamics within agricultural systems calls for a united front of interdisciplinary collaboration from biology to environmental science, agriculture, and public health, which has a crucial role to play. Phytotechnologies offer a sustainable bridge between Se deficiency and toxicity, but further research is needed to optimize these methods and explore their potential in various agricultural and environmental settings.

Certain HMs share common emission sources, necessitating an exploration of the nexus among various HMs for achieving collaborative reductions. Considering the efficacy and feasibility of industrial modification to environmental pressures, this paper proposes a novel nexus-based optimization approach based on nexus analysis, multi-region inputoutput (MRIO) table, and multi-objective optimization to mitigate atmospheric HMs. The atmospheric HM emission inventory in 2017 is first compiled. Subsequently, the Integrated Nexus Strength of HMs Risk (HMR-INS) is proposed and employed to determine the range of sectoral output variations. Finally, a multi-objective optimization approach is employed based on the MRIO table in 2017. Compared with the traditional optimization method, the proposed approach performs better regarding HM-related risks and total output, leading to a 1.9 million tons increase in reduction on HM-related risks and a 1.37 trillion yuan increment in total output. Some further analyses are also given to provide feasible solutions for industrial modification, which considers both the economic efficiency and the stability of the industrial structure.",0048-9697,1879-1026,,, ,  ,

However, previous research often used cellular membrane models with one or few lipid types, which deviates significantly from realistic membrane compositions. Here, employing molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we investigate the impact of a typical nanomaterial, boron nitride (BN), on a cellular membrane model based on the realistic small intestinal epithelial cell (SIEC) membrane. This membrane contains a complex composition, including abundant glycolipids. Our MD simulations reveal that BN nanosheet can partially insert into the SIEC membrane, maintaining a stable binding conformation without causing obvious structural changes. Dynamic analyses suggest that van der Waals (vdW) interactions drive the binding process between BN and the SIEC membrane. Further simulation of the interaction between BN nanosheet and deglycosylated SIEC membrane confirms that BN nanosheet cause significant structural damage to deglycosylated SIEC membranes, completely inserting into the membrane, extracting lipids, and burying some lipid hydrophilic heads within the membrane interior. Quantitative analyses of mean squared displacements (MSD) of membranes, membrane thicknesses, area per lipid, and order parameters indicate that BN nanosheet causes more substantial damage to deglycosylated SIEC membrane than to intact SIEC membrane. This comparison suggests the molecular mechanism involved in mitigating BN invasion by SIEC membrane that the polysaccharide heads of glycolipids in the SIEC membrane form a significant steric hindrance on membrane surface, not only hindering the insertion of BN, but also resisting the lipid extraction by BN. Free energy calculations further support this conclusion. Overall, our MD simulations not only shed new light into the reduced impact of BN nanosheet on the realistic SIEC membrane but also highlight the importance of glycolipids in protecting cell membranes from nanomaterial invasion, contributing to a deeper understanding of nanomaterial-realistic cell membrane interactions.",0269-7491,1873-6424,,, ,  ,

In addition, because of their toxicities, they are increasingly threatening human health. Exposure to toxic elements such as heavy metals (HMs) might contribute to the onset of disorders through their ability to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are involved in cell macromolecule injuries.

This study aimed to investigate the deleterious effects of polystyrene nanoplastics (PS-NPs, 50 nm) and understand their mechanisms in inducing Parkinson's disease (PD)-like neurodegeneration, along with exploring preventive strategies.MethodsFollowing exposure to PS-NPs (0.5-500 mu g/mL), we assessed cytotoxicity, mitochondrial integrity, ATP levels, and mitochondrial respiration in dopaminergic-differentiated SH-SY5Y cells. Molecular docking and dynamic simulations explored PS-NPs' interactions with mitochondrial complexes. We further probed mitophagy's pivotal role in PS-NP-induced mitochondrial damage and examined melatonin's ameliorative potential in vitro. We validated melatonin's intervention (intraperitoneal, 10 mg/kg/d) in C57BL/6 J mice exposed to 250 mg/kg/d of PS-NPs for 28 days.ResultsIn our in vitro experiments, we observed PS-NP accumulation in cells, including mitochondria, leading to cell toxicity and reduced viability. Notably, antioxidant treatment failed to fully rescue viability, suggesting reactive oxygen species (ROS)-independent cytotoxicity. PS-NPs caused significant mitochondrial damage, characterized by altered morphology, reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, and decreased ATP production. Subsequent investigations pointed to PS-NP-induced disruption of mitochondrial respiration, potentially through interference with complex I (CI), a concept supported by molecular docking studies highlighting the influence of PS-NPs on CI. Rescue experiments using an AMPK pathway inhibitor (compound C) and an autophagy inhibitor (3-methyladenine) revealed that excessive mitophagy was induced through AMPK/ULK1 pathway activation, worsening mitochondrial damage and subsequent cell death in differentiated SH-SY5Y cells. Notably, we identified melatonin as a potential protective agent, capable of alleviating PS-NP-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Lastly, our in vivo experiments demonstrated that melatonin could mitigate dopaminergic neuron loss and motor impairments by restoring mitophagy regulation in mice.ConclusionsOur study demonstrated that PS-NPs disrupt mitochondrial function by affecting CI, leading to excessive mitophagy through the AMPK/ULK1 pathway, causing dopaminergic neuron death.

We observed that six of these PFAS bound to both protein isoforms with low- to mid-micromolar dissociation constants. Based on quantitative, competitive binding experiments with endogenous ligands, PFAS can bind orthosterically and preferentially to beta-LG's hydrophobic ligand-binding calyx. beta-Cyclodextrin can also suppress binding of PFAS to beta-LG owing to the ability of beta-cyclodextrin to directly sequester PFAS from solution.

It stands out as one of the rare examples where bimodal imaging probes use organic radicals as the magnetic source, despite their tendency to entirely quench fluorophore fluorescence. Opting for organic radicals over metal-based contrast agents like gadolinium (Gd3+)-chelates is crucial to mitigate associated toxicity concerns. We utilized an amino-terminated polyamide dendrimer containing a 1,8-naphthalimide (Naft) fluorescent group, amino acid derivatives as linkers to enhance water solubility, and TEMPO organic radicals as terminal groups. The same dendrimer structure, featuring an equivalent number of branches but lacking the fluorophore group, was also functionalized with amino acid and terminal radicals to serve as a reference. Remarkably, we achieved a fully water-soluble dendrimer-based structure exhibiting both magnetic and fluorescent properties simultaneously. The fluorescence of the Naft group in the final structure is somewhat quenched by the organic radicals, likely due to photoinduced electron transfer with the nitroxyl radical acting as an electron acceptor, which has been supported by density functional theory calculations.

These textile materials contain a significant amount of carbon and hydrogen in their structure, which can act as fuel for combustion. As a result, these textile materials can be hazardous in the event of a fire accident. Therefore, the application of fire-retardant treatments to textile materials has great importance to mitigate fire risks. Despite the availability of numerous effective flame retardants for textile applications, there is a need to develop new environmentally friendly flame-retardant agents and treatments that are both effective and environmentally friendly. The application of flame-retardant compounds is evolving globally, considering modifications to textile surfaces and the use of environmentally friendly materials. Thus, this review focuses on the functionalization of textile materials with bio-based and eco-friendly flame retardants and reviews recent studies on the use of compounds such as phytic acid, lignin, eggshell, gelatin, chitosan, nanosized/nanomaterial, and phosphorus-containing flame retardants on natural and synthetic textiles.

Biodegradation by native plants to remove this hazardous compound or reduce its toxicity is considered a cost-effective and environmentally sound approach for the cleanup or restoration of TNT-contaminated soils. This study aims to investigate the TNT biodegradation and kinetics by two selected native grasses in the species-specific rhizosphere soils through growth chamber experiments. Native eastern gamma grass (Tripsacum dactyloides) and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) were grown in soil spiked with 14C-TNT for 8 weeks. The 14C-TNT degradation and degradative metabolite profile in the rhizosphere soils were determined by liquid scintillation counter and high-performance liquid chromatography, respectively. The results indicated that both native grass species significantly enhanced the TNT degradation in the rhizosphere soils as compared with the control rhizosphere soils. More than 95% of the applied 14C-TNT was degraded in the first 7 days, and the rate then reached a steady state afterward, but less than 10% of the TNT applied was completely mineralized and transformed into CO2. The degradative reaction was found to follow second-order kinetics. Six major TNT degradative metabolites have been detected and identified in the rhizosphere soils. Overall, switchgrass appeared more effective for biodegrading TNT than eastern gamma grass.

These conveyors, enclosed within troughs or cylindrical bodies, effectively mitigate environmental contamination and material toxicity during transit. Their hermetic design prevents material dispersion by wind, thereby minimizing losses and preserving the integrity of raw materials, particularly those with potential health implications such as urea and cement. Consequently, employing a screw conveyor constitutes a prudent safety measure. Despite the widespread use of screw conveyors, a comprehensive understanding of the behavior of material particles within these systems remains elusive and subject to discrepancies across various methodologies. Presently, a multitude of calculation methods and applications exist, resulting in disparities between theoretical computations and practical implementation. Drawing upon Alan W. Roberts' meticulously devised calculation methodology, renowned for its precision, the authors have developed a swift computational tool utilizing VBA Excel software 2023. Additionally, EDEM simulation software was employed to model granular material behavior. The ensuing calculations guided the selection of optimized technical dimensions for the screw conveyor, which were then fabricated and subjected to real-world testing at the Vinh Tan thermal power plant. Remarkably, the achieved output capacity demonstrated a mere 7% deviation from calculations performed with the VBA program and a 2% variation from those conducted via EDEM simulation.

However, concerns regarding their potential health and environmental impacts have been raised. In this Review, we assess the opportunities of ENMs in environmental applications versus their potential public and environmental health risks, focusing on water treatment and reuse, and identify strategies for their responsible use. Life-cycle analyses indicate that the highest potential environmental and health impacts of ENMs used in commercial products are associated with production rather than incidental release during use. Typically, the detected or predicted ENM concentrations are 1 to 4 orders of magnitude lower than their respective predicted no-effect concentrations. In addition, ENMs often undergo passivating transformations, such as agglomeration and oxidation, reducing risks after release. Therefore, the environmental and health risks of ENMs are relatively low. However, some point sources under extreme scenarios, such as sewage effluent, can potentially increase localized risks. Adopting green chemistry and immobilization strategies can further limit the release of ENMs, minimizing their potential discharge into the environment. Such strategies to reduce toxicity and exposure enable sustainable application of ENMs, such that the environmental benefits could outweigh the risks if managed properly.Engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) have numerous environmental applications, such as in water treatment and reuse. This Review explores the trade-offs between the risks and benefits of environmental ENMs, and highlights that the environmental and health risks of ENMs are relatively low when used responsibly.Environmental applications of nanomaterials include pollution control, green chemistry, clean water production, and sensing and monitoring.Despite the potentially substantial environmental benefits of nanotechnology, the large-scale manufacturing requirements, cost limitations and potential health and environmental risks of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) are common barriers to their widespread use.The environmental and health risks of ENMs are relatively low considering the very low ENM concentrations involved and the passivating transformations that occur in the environment, although the potential human health and ecosystem impacts of long-term (months to years) exposure to low ENM concentrations (for example, sub-microgram per litre level in water) remain largely unexplored.Life-cycle analyses of ENMs used in commercial products indicate that the highest potential environmental and human health risks are associated with production rather than incidental release.To prevent their release into the environment and mitigate exposure, ENMs should be immobilized in or on substrates such as electrodes, membranes and other matrices. Immobilization also enables ENMs to be reused, promoting sustainable and circular practice.Additionally, ENM-enabled products and processes should undergo a certification process to meet regulated safety standards to promote best practice and increase social acceptance.",,2662-138X,,572-587, ,  ,

Studying the behavior of Bystanders role can help in shaping the scale and progression of bullying incidents. However, the lack of data hinders the research in this area. Recently, a dataset, CYBY23, of Twitter threads having main tweets and the replies of Bystanders was published on Kaggle in Oct 2023. The dataset has extracted features related to toxicity and sensitivity of the main tweets and reply tweets. The authors have got manual annotators to assign the labels of Bystanders' roles. Manually labeling bystanders' roles is a labor-intensive task which eventually raises the need to have an automatic labeling technique for identifying the Bystander role. In this work, we aim to suggest a machine-learning model with high efficiency for the automatic labeling of Bystanders. Initially, the dataset was re-sampled using SMOTE to make it a balanced dataset. Next, we experimented with 12 models using various feature engineering techniques. Best features were selected for further experimentation by removing highly correlated and less relevant features. The models were evaluated on the metrics of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. We found that the Random Forest Classifier (RFC) model with a certain set of features is the highest scorer among all 12 models. The RFC model was further tested against various splits of training and test sets. The highest results were achieved using a training set of 85% and a test set of 15%, having 78.83% accuracy, 81.79% precision, 74.83% recall, and 79.45% F1 score.

The application of 0.5 % BN to the soil effectively reduced 24.8 % of diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) Cd in the soil and promoted the conversion of Cd from leaching and HOAc-extractive to reducible forms. BN could improve the adsorption capacity of soil for Cd by promoting the formation of humic acid (HA) and increasing the cation exchange capacity (CEC), as well as activating the oxygen-containing functional groups such as C-O and C--O. BN also increased soil urease and catalase activities and improved the synergistic network among soil bacterial communities to promote soil microbial carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling, thus enhancing Cd passivation. Moreover, BN increased soil biological activity -associated metabolites like T-2 Triol and altered lipid metabolism -related fatty acids, especially hexadecanoic acid and dodecanoic acid, crucial for bacterial Cd tolerance.

Results revealed interspecific, spatial, and organ-specific variability in HM levels. In the Durban Basin, slinger seabream had bioaccumulation (in mg/kg) of As (2.3 & PLUSMN; 0.2), Cr (2.6 & PLUSMN; 0.2), Ni (2.0 & PLUSMN; 0.1), and Pb (4.1 & PLUSMN; 0.3) while cape horse mackerel had Ni (1.6 & PLUSMN; 0.2), Pb (4.7 & PLUSMN; 0.6), and Zn (52 & PLUSMN; 3.01) exceeding World Health Organization (WHO) regulatory limits. Metal pollution index (MPI) values were also higher in Durban Basin (> 5.13) than Cape Vidal (< 3.32) for both species' muscles. Liver and gills of slinger seabream and gut of cape horse mackerel exhibited higher HM accumulation patterns proportionate to the environmental concentrations, indicating the bioindicative potential of HM pollution by the two species. Risk assessment indicated that both fish species had target hazard quotient > 1 for Cr, and target cancer risk < 10(-4) for Pb, implying significant potential non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic health risks associated with fish consumption from the Durban Basin. The study recommends daily consumption limits of 16 g/day for slinger seabream and 14 g/day for cape horse mackerel to ensure health safety.

However, the risk assessment of PTEs in drinking water sources of UCPs is still unknown particularly in developing countries. Hence, the present study investigated the spatial distribution, sources for PTEs (Cd, Cr, Pb, Ni, and Cu), and health risk assessment in drinking water sources of UCPs in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. Among PTEs, Cd, Cr, and Pb had low to high concentrations and exceeded the safe limits of WHO and PAK-EPA in most UCPs. PCA results showed high anthropogenic and low natural sources, contributing to the release of PTEs in all UCPs. Heavy-metal pollution index (PTE-PI) results showed low to high pollution levels for all UCPs, with the highest values of 113 and 116 for Sardaryab Park Charsadda (SPC) and Zoo Park Peshawar (ZPP), respectively. Heavy-metal evaluation index (PTE-EI) results also showed low to high pollution levels for all UCPs. UCPs samples (50%) showed low pollution levels in PTE-PI results. To the contrary, UCPs samples (50%) exhibited high pollution levels in PTE-EI results. The non-carcinogenic risk of HQ and HI values of all PTEs were below the permissible limit (<1) for adults and children via ingestion and dermal contact. CR and TCR results showed that PTEs (Cr, Cd, Pb, and Ni) had the highest carcinogenic risk (>1.00 x 10(-4)) for both adults and children in all UCPs, except Cd and Ni for adults via the ingestion route, while Cr values (>1.00 x 10(-4)) were exceeded for children in some of the UCPs via the dermal route. Consequently, long-term exposure to toxic PTEs could pose a carcinogenic risk to the local population. Thus, the present study suggests that the government should implement enforcement with firm protocols and monitoring guidelines of environmental regulations to mitigate PTEs originating from anthropogenic sources in order to reduce health risks and improve public health safety in urban areas.",,2071-1050,,, ,  ,

These creators often engage in controversial behaviour to drive engagement, which can foster toxicity. This paper presents a quantitative analysis of controversial content on YouTube, focusing on the relationship between controversy, toxicity, and monetisation. We introduce a curated dataset comprising 20 controversial YouTube channels extracted from Reddit discussions, including 16,349 videos and more than 105 million comments. We identify and categorise monetisation cues from video descriptions into various models, including affiliate marketing and direct selling, using lists of URLs and keywords. Additionally, we train a machine learning model to measure the toxicity of comments in these videos. Our findings reveal that while toxic comments correlate with higher engagement, they negatively impact monetisation, indicating that controversy-driven interaction does not necessarily lead to financial gain. We also observed significant variation in monetisation strategies, with some creators showing extensive monetisation despite high toxicity levels.

Healthy conversations are crucial for creating an inclusive environment and maintaining harmony in an organization. Toxic communications at workplace can negatively impact overall job satisfaction and are often subtle, hidden or demonstrate human biases. The linguistic subtlety of mild yet hurtful conversations has made it difficult for researchers to quantify and extract toxic conversations automatically. While offensive language or hate speech has been extensively studied in social communities, there has been little work studying toxic workplace communications. Specifically, the lack of corpus, sparsity of toxicity in enterprise emails and a well-defined criteria for annotating toxic conversations have prevented researchers from addressing the problem at scale. We take the first step towards studying toxicity in workplace communications by providing (1) a general and computationally viable taxonomy to study toxic language at workplace (2) a dataset to study toxic language at workplace based on the taxonomy and (3) analysis on why offensive language and hate-speech datasets are not suitable to detect workplace toxicity.

However, the process of selecting an appropriate algorithm and fine-tuning hyperparameters for the developing of optimized models takes considerable time, expertise, and an intensive search. The recent emergence of automated machine learning (autoML) approaches, available as user-friendly platforms, has proven beneficial for individuals with limited knowledge in ML-based predictive model development. These autoML platforms automate crucial steps in model development, including data preprocessing, algorithm selection, and hyperparameter tuning. In this study, we used seven previously published and publicly available datasets for oxides and metals to develop nanotoxicity prediction models. AutoML platforms, namely Vertex AI, Azure, and Dataiku, were employed and performance measures such as accuracy, F1 score, precision, and recall for these autoML-based models were then compared with those of conventional ML-based models. The results demonstrated clearly that the autoML platforms produced more reliable nanotoxicity prediction models, outperforming those built with conventional ML algorithms. While none of the three autoML platforms significantly outperformed the others, distinctions exist among them in terms of the available options for choosing technical features throughout the model development steps. This allows users to select an autoML platform that aligns with their knowledge of predictive model development and its technical features.

The novelty lies in using double layers of hybrid CNN-RNN to enhance hate speech detection accuracy. This research also employed an oversampling technique alongside the double-layer model. The process included preprocessing, feature extraction, training tuning, testing, and performance evaluation. The results demonstrated that the double-layer hybrid CNN-RNN model achieved an accuracy of 0.827, a precision of 0.797, a recall of 0.759, and an F1 score of 0.883, with imbalanced data.

As these models impact real human lives, ensuring accuracy and fairness of such models is critical. However, maintaining the performance of these models over time can be challenging due to the temporal shifts in the application context and the sub-populations represented. Furthermore, there is often a delay in obtaining human expert labels for the raw data, which hinders the timely adaptation and safe deployment of the models. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach that anticipates future distributions of data, especially in settings where unlabeled data becomes available earlier than the labels to estimate the future distribution of labels per sub-population and adapt the model preemptively. We evaluate our approach using multiple temporally-shifting datasets and consider bias based on racial, political, and demographic identities.

Drawing from an extensive dataset that spans eight platforms over 34 years-from Usenet to contemporary social media-our findings show consistent conversation patterns and user behaviour, irrespective of the platform, topic or time.

Fortunately, the research community has responded to these challenges by developing minimum reporting standards that address several of these issues. By converting twelve published minimum reporting standards into a machine-readable representation using FAIR maturity indicators, we have created a machine-friendly approach to annotate and assess datasets' reusability according to those standards. Furthermore, our NanoSafety Data Reusability Assessment (NSDRA) framework includes a metadata generator web application that can be integrated into experimental data management, and a new web application that can summarize the reusability of nanosafety datasets for one or more subsets of maturity indicators, tailored to specific computational risk assessment use cases. This approach enhances the transparency, communication, and reusability of experimental data and metadata. With this improved FAIR approach, we can facilitate the reuse of nanosafety research for exploration, toxicity prediction, and regulation, thereby advancing the field and benefiting society as a whole.",,2052-4463,,, ,  ,

Existing uncontrolled VIPLoc benchmark assumes that the image has one single VIP, which is not suitable for actual application scenarios when multiple VIPs or no VIPs appear in the image. In this paper, we re-built a complex uncontrolled conditions (CUC) dataset to make the VIPLoc closer to the actual situation, containing no, single, and multiple VIPs. Existing methods use the hand-designed and deep learning strategies to extract the features of persons and analyze the differences between VIPs and other persons from the perspective of statistics. They are not explainable as to why the VIP located this output for that input. Thus, there exist the severe performance degradation when we use these models in real-world VIPLoc. Specifically, we establish a causal inference framework that unpacks the causes of previous methods and derives a new principled solution for VIPLoc. It treats the scene as confounding factor, allowing the ever-elusive confounding effects to be eliminated and the essential determinants to be uncovered.

However, the behavioural patterns of these systems are often opaque, complicating the evaluation of their impact on the dissemination and consumption of disinformation and misinformation. To begin addressing this evidence gap, this study presents a measurement approach that uses observed digital traces to infer the status of algorithmic amplification of low-credibility content on Twitter over a 14-day period in January 2023. Using an original dataset of approximate to 2.7 million posts on COVID-19 and climate change published on the platform, this study identifies tweets sharing information from low-credibility domains, and uses a bootstrapping model with two stratifications, a tweet's engagement level and a user's followers level, to compare any differences in impressions generated between low-credibility and high-credibility samples. Additional stratification variables of toxicity, political bias, and verified status are also examined. This analysis provides valuable observational evidence on whether the Twitter algorithm favours the visibility of low-credibility content, with results indicating that, on aggregate, tweets containing low-credibility URL domains perform better than tweets that do not across both datasets. However, this effect is largely attributable to a difference in high-engagement, high-followers tweets, which are very impactful in terms of impressions generation, and are more likely receive amplified visibility when containing low-credibility content. Furthermore, high toxicity tweets and those with right-leaning bias see heightened amplification, as do low-credibility tweets from verified accounts. Ultimately, this suggests that Twitter's recommender system may have facilitated the diffusion of false content by amplifying the visibility of low-credibility content with high-engagement generated by very influential users.",,2193-1127,,, ,  ,

We aimed to study the dynamics of electrodermal activity (EDA) while breathing elevated PO2 in the hyperbaric environment (HBO2) as a possible means to predict impending CNS-OT. To this end, we used machine learning to automatically detect and predict the onset of symptoms associated with CNS-OT in humans by using features derived from EDA in both time and frequency domains.Methods: We collected electrodermal activity (EDA) data from forty-nine exposures to HBO2 while subjects were undergoing cognitive load and exercise in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber. Four independent experts were present during the experiment to monitor and classify any symptoms associated with hyperbaric oxygen toxicity. We computed a highly sensitive time varying spectral EDA index, named TVSymp, and extracted informative features from skin conductance responses (SCRs). Machine learning algorithms were trained and validated for classifying features from SCRs and TVSymp as CNS-OT related or non-CNS-OT related. Machine learning models were validated using a subject -independent leave one subject out (LOSO) validation scheme.Results: Our machine learning model was able to classify EDA dynamics related to CNS-OT with 100 % sensitivity and 84 % specificity via LOSO validation.

Particularly, it is hard to generate inputs that can comprehensively trigger potential bias due to the lack of data containing both social groups and biased properties.

By incorporating a blending parameter, HRP optimises the contributions of the NRP and PMRP, reducing the dimensions of the data while ensuring that the structure of the data is preserved. Conventional methods, such as NRP and PMRP, are recognised for their benefits; however, they also have limitations. NRP is generally accurate but can encounter difficulties with certain data types or noise. The PMRP is simple, but occasionally fails to capture complex relationships within the data. The performance of HRP is investigated through comprehensive evaluations, including simulations and real-world data analyses from key machine learning datasets, such as period change, toxicity, MNIST, and human activity recognition (HAR). We examine various factors such as sample size, dimensions of the original and reduced data, and sparsity. Distance distortion is the primary metric utilised to measure performance, and indicates how well the dataset structure is maintained after dimension reduction. In every test, HRP consistently demonstrates the least distance distortion, performing superiorly to the NRP and PMRP. This is true fora range of scenarios and datasets. HRP represents a significant advancement in dimension reduction techniques. Its ability to minimise information loss during the reduction process demonstrates its potential as a powerful tool for managing complex high-dimensional data in practical applications.

Therefore, using methods from the causal inference literature, we propose an algorithm to regularize the learnt effect of the features on the model's prediction to the estimated effect of feature on label. This results in an automated augmentation method that leverages the estimated effect of a feature to appropriately change the labels for new augmented inputs.

EvaluatingWinning Tickets Across Demographics,,, ,Proceedings Paper ,2021,"Recent studies have suggested that weight pruning, e.g. using lottery ticket extraction techniques (Frankle and Carbin, 2018), comes at the risk of compromising the group fairness of machine learning models (Paganini, 2020; Hooker et al., 2020), but to the best of our knowledge, no one has empirically evaluated this hypothesis at scale in the context of natural language processing. We present experiments with two text classification datasets annotated with demographic information: the Trustpilot Corpus (sentiment) and CivilComments (toxicity). We evaluate the fairness of lottery ticket extraction through layer-wise and global weight pruning across three languages and two tasks. Our results suggest that there is a small increase in group disparity, which is most pronounced at high pruning rates and correlates with instability. The fairness of models trained with distributionally robust optimization objectives is sometimes less sensitive to pruning, but results are not consistent.

Since the approaches for general offensive content detection face a challenge in detecting misogynistic content, it requires solutions tailored to address offensive content against women. To this end, we propose a novel multimodal framework for the detection of misogynistic and sexist content. The framework comprises three modules: the Multimodal Attention module (MANM), the Graph-based Feature Reconstruction Module (GFRM), and the Content-specific Features Learning Module (CFLM). The MANM employs adaptive gating-based multimodal context-aware attention, enabling the model to focus on relevant visual and textual information and generating contextually relevant features. The GFRM module utilizes graphs to refine features within individual modalities, while the CFLM focuses on learning text and image-specific features such as toxicity features and caption features. Additionally, we curate a set of misogynous lexicons to compute the misogyny-specific lexicon score from the text. We apply test-time augmentation in feature space to better generalize the predictions on diverse inputs. The performance of the proposed approach has been evaluated on two multimodal datasets, MAMI, and MMHS150K, with 11,000 and 13,494 samples, respectively.

Designing and testing different CPPs to target specific cells or tissues is crucial to ensure high delivery efficiency and reduced toxicity. However, in vivo/in vitro testing of various CPPs can be both time-consuming and costly, which has led to interest in computational methodologies, such as Machine Learning (ML) approaches, as faster and cheaper methods for CPP design and uptake prediction. However, most ML models developed to date focus on classification rather than regression techniques, because of the lack of informative quantitative uptake values. To address these challenges, we developed POSEIDON, an open-access and up-to-date curated database that provides experimental quantitative uptake values for over 2,300 entries and physicochemical properties of 1,315 peptides. POSEIDON also offers physicochemical properties, such as cell line, cargo, and sequence, among others. By leveraging this database along with cell line genomic features, we processed a dataset of over 1,200 entries to develop an ML regression CPP uptake predictor. Our results demonstrated that POSEIDON accurately predicted peptide cell line uptake, achieving a Pearson correlation of 0.87, Spearman correlation of 0.88, and r2 score of 0.76, on an independent test set.

However, this treatment is associated with a high risk of mortality. Predicting survival after BMT is therefore essential for effective and accurate treatment. BMT is considered a treatment -related mortality due to several primary causes of death such as infections, toxicity, and Graft -versus -Host Disease (GvHD) that occur after treatment. In addition, several risk factors affect the success of BMT and long-term survival after treatment. Therefore, there is a need for a prediction system based on machine learning techniques that can predict whether the patient will survive after BMT or not, which will definitely help the physicians to make the right decisions before performing the surgery for the patient. In this paper, using a publicly available BMT dataset from the University of California, Irvine ML repository (UCI ML repository), different machine learning models were investigated to predict the survival status of children undergoing BMT treatment. In particular, Random Forest (RF), Bagging Classifier, Extreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), Decision Tree (DT), Gradient Boost (GB), and K -Nearest Neighbors (KNN) were trained on the given dataset. The dataset consists of 45 variables after applying a series of preprocessing steps and removing the multicollinearity features based on the correlation heat map. Then, a feature engineering and modelling step was applied to identify the most significant features, followed by the use of machine learning models to simplify the overall classification process. It's important to note that the most important features obtained by DT and those obtained by GB were the most suitable for training the Bagging classifier and the KNN model, respectively. In addition to that, hyper -parameters optimization using Grid Search Cross -Validation (GSCV) was applied to both approaches to improve the accuracy of the survival prediction.

Since then, additional information about the toxicity of nickel to aquatic organisms and the effects of water chemistry conditions on nickel bioavailability have become available, and there is much more information available about the water chemistry conditions that affect nickel toxicity in freshwaters. This study has taken the updated information about nickel ecotoxicity and bioavailability and evaluates how this could potentially affect the EQS for nickel if it was to be updated. Although the sensitivity of freshwaters to nickel based on the update is very similar to the EQS on a site-specific basis, the thresholds derived are slightly lower. A broader range of water chemistry conditions can be covered by the update than are currently covered by the existing EQS. An updated standard of 2.9 mu g L-1 bioavailable nickel could be derived based on the UK dataset evaluated here, which is slightly lower than the existing EQS of 4 mu g L-1 bioavailable nickel. Consequently, a slightly higher number of potential compliance failures would be expected based on the update. A simple and practical approach toward the incorporation of local nickel background concentrations into the compliance assessment process for sites that fail the bioavailability based EQS is also proposed. Initial assessments suggest that compliance with the existing EQS could potentially result in more than 5% of species in freshwater aquatic ecosystems being affected, but that with the exception of a very small number of cases the proportion of potentially affected species would be less than 8% of species in the ecosystem. In regions where the existing EQS is not fully implemented, particularly through limited consideration of bioavailability, the adoption of the updated standard is likely to be less beneficial than focusing on better implementation of the existing EQS. However, in regions where the existing EQS has been implemented extensively for some time the updated standard offers a refinement in terms of the coverage of a higher proportion of surface waters and a slightly higher level of protection for sensitive species than the existing EQS.Updated information about nickel ecotoxicity and bioavailability has been used to evaluate whether the EQS for nickel should be revised.",,2754-7000,,1139-1152, ,  ,

In addition to the FAIR data, what is required for the application of computational tools, such as Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships (QSARs), is a sufficient data volume and the ability to merge sources into homogeneous digital assets. In the nanosafety domain there is a lack of FAIR available metadata.Methodology: To address this challenge, we utilized 34 datasets from the nanosafety domain by exploiting the NanoSafety Data Reusability Assessment (NSDRA) framework, which allowed the annotation and assessment of dataset's reusability. From the framework's application results, eight datasets targeting the same endpoint (i.e. numerical cellular viability) were selected, processed and merged to test several hypothesis including universal versus nanogroup-specific QSAR models (metal oxide and nanotubes), and regression versus classification Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. Results: Universal regression and classification QSARs reached an 0.86 R2 and 0.92 accuracy, respectively, for the test set. Nanogroup-specific regression models reached 0.88 R2 for nanotubes test set followed by metal oxide (0.78). Nanogroup-specific classification models reached 0.99 accuracy for nanotubes test set, followed by metal oxide (0.91). Feature importance revealed different patterns depending on the dataset with common influential features including core size, exposure conditions and toxicological assay. Even in the case where the available experimental knowledge was merged, the models still failed to correctly predict the outputs of an unseen dataset, revealing the cumbersome conundrum of scientific reproducibility in realistic applications of QSAR for nanosafety. To harness the full potential of computational tools and ensure their long-term applications, embracing FAIR data practices is imperative in driving the development of responsible QSAR models. Conclusions: This study reveals that the digitalization of nanosafety knowledge in a reproducible manner has a long way towards its successful pragmatic implementation. The workflow carried out in the study shows a promising approach to increase the FAIRness across all the elements of computational studies, from dataset's annotation, selection, merging to FAIR modeling reporting. This has significant implications for future research as it provides an example of how to utilize and report different tools available in the nanosafety knowledge system, while increasing the transparency of the results. One of the main benefits of this workflow is that it promotes data sharing and reuse, which is essential for advancing scientific knowledge by making data and metadata FAIR compliant.

Building on our previous work, which utilized a specialized aquatic tank with a mirror and a single camera for fish movement tracking in three dimensions, F3LA significantly enhances data processing efficiency. Its accuracy was tested by reanalyzing and comprehensively comparing the calculated data with the previously published data from prior publications. From the comparison results, 90% of endpoints showed a similar statistical difference result. These minor differences were due to the different starting points for the dataset and updated calculation formulas that are implemented in F3LA. In addition, shoaling area or shoaling volume calculations are also included in F3LA as a new feature that can serve as sensitive indicators of social cohesion, group dynamics, or stress responses, offering insights into neuropsychological conditions or the effects of pharmacological interventions. Furthermore, F3LA offers a marked improvement over manual operations, being at least five times faster, while maintaining consistent accuracy as it reduces human-induced errors, ensuring a higher degree of reliability in the results. Finally, the potency of F3LA was tested to evaluate the toxicities of 14 rare earth elements (REEs) to the adult zebrafish behaviors. Based on the results, our findings suggested that each tested REE altered fish behaviors in different patterns and magnitudes to each other. However, among the tested light rare earth elements (LREEs), neodymium was demonstrated to cause more relatively severe behavior alterations than other LREEs, indicated by the statistically higher value of entropy (0.2695 +/- 0.04977 (mean with a standard deviation)) than the control group (0.2352 +/- 0.05896). Meanwhile, in terms of heavy rare earth elements (HREEs), erbium seemed to lead to more distinct behavior toxicities than other HREEs, which was shown by the statistically lower level of fractal dimension (2.022 +/- 0.3412) than the untreated group (2.255 +/- 0.1661). Taken together, F3LA's development marks a significant advance in high-throughput toxicological and pharmacological assessments in zebrafish, leveraging three-dimensional locomotion data for a more comprehensive analysis of fish behavior performance, providing a significant contribution to research in various fields.",0022-1112,1095-8649,,, ,  ,

In this paper, we propose a deep-learning-based multiorgan segmentation approach for the thoracic region, using EfficientNet as the backbone for the network architecture. The objectives of this approach include accurate segmentation of critical organs, such as the left and right lungs, the heart, the spinal cord, and the esophagus, essential for minimizing radiation toxicity during external radiation therapy. Our proposed approach, when evaluated on an internal dataset comprising 81 patients, demonstrated superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, the results for our approach with a 2.5D strategy were as follows: a dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.820 +/- 0.041, an intersection over union (IoU) of 0.725 +/- 0.052, and a 3D Hausdorff distance (HD) of 10.353 +/- 4.974 mm. Notably, the 2.5D strategy surpassed the 2D strategy in all three metrics, exhibiting higher DSC and IoU values, as well as lower HD values. This improvement strongly suggests that our proposed approach with the 2.5D strategy may hold promise in achieving more precise and accurate segmentations when compared to the conventional 2D strategy.

Further development of memristive technologies depends on the availability of suitable materials. These materials should be easily available, stable, and preferably of low toxicity. Commonly used materials are lead halide perovskites, however, they are highly toxic and unstable under ambient conditions. Therefore a novel material is developed on the basis of bismuth iodide. In reaction with butylammonium iodide, it yields a novel compound, butylammonium iodobismuthate (BABI). Here, a diffusive memristor is introduced based on this compound and evaluates its memristive and neuromorphic properties. In contrast to nonvolatile memristors, the BABI memristors exhibit diffusive dynamics, which enable them to store the information only for short periods of time. This property is utilized to mimic the short-term synaptic plasticity described by the leaky integrate-and-fire model of a biological neuron. Combined with high switching uniformity and self-rectifying behavior, these devices show high classification accuracy for MNIST handwritten datasets, paving the way for their application in neuromorphic computing systems.Butylammonium iodobismuthate presents unique volatile memristive properties resulting from diffusive dynamics of iodide vacancies.

We compared these validation metrics by checking their sample size dependence, rank correlations to other metrics and uncertainty. We used modeling methods from multivariate linear regression to artificial neural network on 14 open access datasets. We found that the metrics provide similar sample size dependence and correlation to other validation parameters. The individual uncertainty originating from the calculation recipes of the metrics is much smaller for both ways than the part caused by the selection of the training set or the training/test split. We concluded that the metrics of the two techniques are interchangeable, but the interpretation of cross-validation parameters is easier according to their similar range to goodness-of-fit and prediction metrics. Furthermore, the variance originating from the random elements of the calculation of cross-validation metrics is slightly smaller than those of bootstrap ones, if equal calculation load is applied.The two methods provide close to the same information on robustness, but we suggest to use cross-validation, because: a) Bootstrap values are outliers within the metrics for other validation tasks as goodness-of-fit or predictivity. b) The uncertainty of the robustness calculation is smaller for cross-validation at equal calculation load.image",0886-9383,1099-128X,,, ,  ,

Accurate and informative analysis of spine shape has an urgent need for studying the synaptic processes and molecular pathways in normal and pathological conditions, and for testing synapto-protective strategies during preclinical studies. Primary neuronal cultures enable high quality imaging of dendritic spines and offer a wide spectrum of accessible experimental manipulations. This article outlines the protocol for isolating, culturing, fluorescent labeling, and imaging of mouse primary hippocampal neurons by three-dimensional (3D) confocal microscopy in a normal state and in conditions of low amyloid toxicity-an in vitro model of Alzheimer's disease. An alternate protocol describes the neuronal morphology analysis using the EGFP expressing neurons in line-M transgenic mouse brain slices. Since the dendritic spines are relatively small structures lying close to the confocal microscope resolution limit, their proper segmentation on the images is challenging. This protocol highlights the image-preprocessing steps, including generation of theoretical point spread function and deconvolution, which enhances resolution and removes noise, thereby enhancing the 3D spine reconstruction results.

CBCT is deemed to be secure for patients, making it suitable for the delivery of fractional doses. However, limitations such as a narrow field of view, beam hardening, scattered radiation artifacts, and variability in pixel intensity hinder the direct use of raw CBCT for dose recalculation during treatment. To address this issue, reliable correction techniques are necessary to remove artifacts and remap pixel intensity into Hounsfield Units (HU) values. This study proposes a deep-learning framework for calibrating CBCT images acquired with narrow field of view (FOV) systems and demonstrates its potential use in proton treatment planning updates. Cycle-consistent generative adversarial networks (cGAN) processes raw CBCT to reduce scatter and remap HU. Monte Carlo simulation is used to generate CBCT scans, enabling the possibility to focus solely on the algorithm's ability to reduce artifacts and cupping effects without considering intra-patient longitudinal variability and producing a fair comparison between planning CT (pCT) and calibrated CBCT dosimetry. To showcase the viability of the approach using real-world data, experiments were also conducted using real CBCT. Tests were performed on a publicly available dataset of 40 patients who received ablative radiation therapy for pancreatic cancer. The simulated CBCT calibration led to a difference in proton dosimetry of less than 2%, compared to the planning CT. The potential toxicity effect on the organs at risk decreased from about 50% (uncalibrated) up the 2% (calibrated).

The combined clinico-radiomics model based on textural features extracted from the most significant cluster improved the prediction of bevacizumab response, compared with a clinical-only model (AUC:0.755 [0.645-0.865] to 0.852 [0.764-0.940], training; 0.708 [0.554-0.861] to 0.816 [0.699-0.933], validation). Conclusion: Our radiomics approach yielded intralesional resolution, enabling a more refined feature selection for predicting bevacizumab efficacy in the treatment of RN.",2001-0370,,,43-51, ,  ,

This study aims to predict radiotherapy-induced rectal and bladder toxicity using computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) radiomics features in combination with clinical and dosimetric features in rectal cancer patients. Methods. A total of sixty-three patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who underwent three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) were included in this study. Radiomics features were extracted from the rectum and bladder walls in pretreatment CT and MR-T2W-weighted images. Feature selection was performed using various methods, including Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso), Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (MRMR), Chi-square (Chi2), Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), and SelectPercentile. Predictive modeling was carried out using machine learning algorithms, such as K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Naive Bayes (NB), Gradient Boosting (XGB), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). The impact of the Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) filter was investigated with sigma values ranging from 0.5 to 2. Model performance was evaluated in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity. Results. A total of 479 radiomics features were extracted, and 59 features were selected. The pre-MRI T2W model exhibited the highest predictive performance with an AUC: 91.0/96.57%, accuracy: 90.38/96.92%, precision: 90.0/97.14%, sensitivity: 93.33/96.50%, and specificity: 88.09/97.14%. These results were achieved with both original image and LoG filter (sigma = 0.5-1.5) based on LDA/DT-RF classifiers for proctitis and cystitis, respectively. Furthermore, for the CT data, AUC: 90.71/96.0%, accuracy: 90.0/96.92%, precision: 88.14/97.14%, sensitivity: 93.0/96.0%, and specificity: 88.09/97.14% were acquired. The highest values were achieved using XGB/DT-XGB classifiers for proctitis and cystitis with LoG filter (sigma = 2)/LoG filter (sigma = 0.5-2), respectively. MRMR/RFE-Chi2 feature selection methods demonstrated the best performance for proctitis and cystitis in the pre-MRI T2W model. MRMR/MRMR-Lasso yielded the highest model performance for CT. Conclusion. Radiomics features extracted from pretreatment CT and MR images can effectively predict radiation-induced proctitis and cystitis. The study found that LDA, DT, RF, and XGB classifiers, combined with MRMR, RFE, Chi2, and Lasso feature selection algorithms, along with the LoG filter, offer strong predictive performance. With the inclusion of a larger training dataset, these models can be valuable tools for personalized radiotherapy decision-making.",2057-1976,,,, ,  ,

This retrospective study aimed to investigate situations of work-related diseases and injuries among agriculturists in upper northeast Thailand. Methods: The secondary data of international classification of diseases 10 th revision (ICD-10) case reports of occupational disease among farmers, from the database of the Health Data Center (HDC), were used. The registered farmers data was collected as a dataset from the provincial agricultural office and the data of ICD-10 code utilised from the hospital information system (HIS) of healthcare services in Udon Thani and Roi-Et provinces, which was extracted for cases of work-related diseases and injuries of registered agriculturists. The annual morbidity rate of occupational diseases was analysed and presented at a rate per 100,000 farmers. Results: Among farmers in the HDC database, lung disease, which was not reported as occupational disease of the HDC database, was the highest ranking of all diseases, followed by work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs), noise- and heat-related diseases, and pesticide toxicity, respectively, while the injury rate was as high as that of WMSDs. Those morbidity rates of Roi-Et and Udon Thani provinces were representative of the morbidity ranking of diseases of the nation and had increasing trends from 2014 to 2016. The number of farmers in the HDC database did not consistently reflect the number of registered farmers in the agricultural database. Conclusions: Situations of work-related diseases and injuries discovered among registered farmers reflect the health problems of Thai agriculturists, and the underestimation in the reported disease rate in the health database is explained by big data analysis, which showed that work-related cases with an identifying code of Y96 had rarely been reported among agriculturists.

Depending on the shell portion affected, on the extent of damage, and on toxicity, flammability, and reactivity of stored substances, liquid leakages can trigger hazardous chains of events whose consequences affect not only the plant but also the surrounding environment. In light of that, the study proposed herein provides an analysis of the seismic fragility of cylindrical above ground storage tanks based on observational damage data. The first phase of this work has consisted in collecting a large empirical dataset of information on failures of atmospheric tanks during past earthquakes. Two sets of damage states have then been used in order to characterize the severity of damage and the intensity of liquid releases. Empirical fragility curves have been fitted by using Bayesian regression. The advantage of this approach is that it is well suited to treat direct and indirect information obtained from field observations and to incorporate subjective engineering judgement. Different models have been employed in order to investigate the effects of tank aspect ratio, filling level, and base anchorage. Moreover, the effects of interaction between these critical aspects are included in fragility analysis. The hazard parameter used is the peak ground acceleration (PGA).

To analyze various contrast agent concentrations, we produced contrast agent concentration samples (20, 40, 60, 80, and 100%) and inserted them into a phantom model of a one-year-old pediatric patient. Single-energy computed tomography (SECT) and dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) images were acquired from the phantom, and 40 kilo-electron-volt (keV) VMI was acquired based on the DECT images. For the 40 keV VMI, the smoothing factor of the FNLM algorithm was applied from 0.01 to 1.00 in increments of 0.01. We derived the optimized value of the FNLM algorithm based on quantitative evaluation and performed a comparative assessment with SECT, DECT, and a total variation (TV) algorithm. As a result of the analysis, we found that the average contrast to noise ratio (CNR) and coefficient of variation (COV) of each concentration were most improved at a smoothing factor of 0.02. Based on these results, we derived the optimized smoothing factor value of 0.02. Comparative evaluation shows that the optimized FNLM algorithm improves the CNR and COV results by approximately 3.14 and 2.45 times, respectively, compared with the DECT image, and the normalized noise power spectrum result shows a 10-1 mm2 improvement. The main contribution of this study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of an optimized FNLM algorithm in reducing noise in pediatric abdominal VMI, allowing high-quality images to be acquired while reducing contrast dose. This advancement has significant implications for minimizing the risk of contrast-induced toxicity, especially in pediatric patients. Our approach addresses the problem of limited datasets in pediatric imaging by providing a computationally efficient noise reduction technique and highlights the clinical applicability of the FNLM algorithm. In addition, effective noise reduction enables high-contrast imaging with minimal radiation and contrast exposure, which is expected to be suitable for repeat CT examinations of pediatric liver cancer patients and other abdominal diseases.",2079-9292,,,, ,  ,

The effect of contact size (in the clinical range: 1-10 mm(2)) on HFO detection has not been determined. This study assesses the feasibility of HFO detection in a rat epilepsy model using macrocontacts and clinical amplifiers, and the effect of contact size on HFO detection within the macrocontact range.Methods: Eight epileptic rats were implanted with intracerebral electrodes containing three adjacent contacts of different sizes (0.02, 0.05 and 0.09 mm(2)). HFOs were manually marked on 5 min interictal EEG segments. HFO rates and durations were compared between the different contacts.Results: 10,966 ripples and 1475 fast ripples were identified in the recordings from 30 contacts. There were no significant differences in spike or HFO rates between the different contact sizes, nor was there a significant difference in HFO duration.Conclusions: HFOs can be detected in a rat epilepsy model using macrocontacts. Within the studied range, size did not significantly influence HFO detection.Significance: Using comparative anatomy of rat and human limbic structures, these findings suggest that reducing the size of macrocontacts (compared to those commercially available) would not improve HFO detection rates.

Obtaining the concentrations of the three nitrogenous compounds simultaneously can allow us to comprehensively analyze nitrogen cycling in archipelago waters, which is beneficial to the ecological protection of both agriculture and fisheries. The existing studies have usually considered a single nitrogen compound or dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), which can only identify the water quality but cannot comprehensively judge the water purification situation or the toxicity of the nitrogen compounds in the water. In the process of constructing an inversion model, only the specific bands of remote sensing imageries used in training/learning are directly related to the actual measured values, ignoring the fact that the specific bands contain information on water quality parameters is different that would affect the fitting accuracy. Furthermore, the existing empirical models and machine learning models have not yet been applied to high-resolution inversion in archipelago waters with active fishing activities. In view of this, we constructed a multiple weighted regression model considering spatial characteristics (S-WSVR) to simultaneously retrieve the distribution of NH4-N, NO2-N, and NO3-N in archipelagic waters. By using the S-WSVR model and considering the complexity of the spatial distribution of the three nitrogen compounds in the mesoscale archipelagic waters, longitude and latitude were added to the experimental dataset as spatial features to fit the nonlinear spatial relationships. Meanwhile, a multivariate weighting module based on the Mahalanobis distance was integrated to calculate the contribution of the characteristic bands and improve the inversion accuracy. The S-WSVR model was applied in the water of Changshan Islands, China, with a retrieval resolution of 30 m, and the r-values of the three nitrogen compounds achieved 0.9063, 0.8900, and 0.9755, respectively. Notably, the sum of the three nitrogen compounds has an r-value of 0.9028 when compared with the measured DIN. In addition, we obtained the Landsat 8 characteristic bands for the three nitrogen compounds and plotted the spatial distributions of the nitrogen compounds in spring and autumn from 2013 to 2022. By analyzing the spatio-temporal variations, it was apparent that the three nitrogen compounds are controlled by human activities and river inputs, and the anoxic discharge of the Yalu River has a strong influence on NO2-N content. Therefore, the accurate estimation in this study can provide scientific support for the protection of sensitive archipelago ecosystems.",,2073-4441,,, ,  ,

Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in toxic content detection due to their superior zero-shot and few-shot in-context learning ability as well as broad transferability on ML tasks. However, efficiently designing prompts for LLMs remains challenging. Moreover, the high run-time cost of LLMs may hinder their deployments in production. To address these challenges, in this work, we propose BD-LLM, a novel and efficient approach to Bootstrapping and Distilling LLMs for toxic content detection. Specifically, we design a novel prompting method named Decision-Tree-of-Thought (DToT) to bootstrap LLMs' detection performance and extract high-quality rationales. DToT can automatically select more fine-grained context to re-prompt LLMs when their responses lack confidence. Additionally, we use the rationales extracted via DToT to fine-tune student LMs. Our experimental results on various datasets demonstrate that DToT can improve the accuracy of LLMs by up to 4.6%. Furthermore, student LMs fine-tuned with rationales extracted via DToT outperform baselines on all datasets with up to 16.9% accuracy improvement, while being more than 60x smaller than conventional LLMs. Finally, we observe that student LMs fine-tuned with rationales exhibit better cross-dataset transferability.",2159-5399,2374-3468,*****************,21779-21787, , 38th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) / 36th Conference on Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence / 14th Symposium on Educational Advances in Artificial Intelligence38th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) / 36th Conference on Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence / 14th Symposium on Educational Advances in Artificial Intelligence ,

We find little evidence of the glamorisation of cybercrime. However, lyrics often depict a 'gangster' lifestyle, including the promotion of violence.

As a result, detecting harmful memes has become a crucial task for maintaining online safety and fostering responsible online behavior. Prior research in this field has mainly targeted multimodal internal aspects of memes, specifically the image and text modalities, and has sought to interpret their significance by analyzing intra- and inter -modality signals via sophisticated visual -language models.

However, there is a rise of sarcastic memes on social media, which often convey contrary meaning to the implied sentiments and challenge traditional machine learning identification techniques. The memes, blending text and visuals on social media, are difficult to discern solely from the captions or images, as their humor often relies on subtle contextual cues requiring a nuanced understanding for accurate interpretation. Our study introduces Offensive Images and Sarcastic Memes Detection to address this problem. Our model employs various techniques to identify sarcastic memes and offensive images. The model uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and bidirectional long-short term memory (Bi-LSTM) for sarcastic meme detection. For offensive image detection, the model employs Autoencoder LSTM, deep learning models such as Densenet and mobilenet, and computer vision techniques like Feature Fusion Process (FFP) based on Transfer Learning (TL) with Image Augmentation. The study showcases the effectiveness of the proposed methods in achieving high accuracy in detecting offensive content across different modalities, such as text, memes, and images. Based on tests conducted on real-world datasets, our model has demonstrated an accuracy rate of 92% on the Hateful Memes Challenge dataset. The proposed methodology has also achieved a Testing Accuracy (TA) of 95.7% for Densenet with transfer learning on the NPDI dataset and 95.12% on the Pornography dataset. Moreover, implementing Transfer Learning with a Feature Fusion Process (FFP) has resulted in a TA of 99.45% for the NPDI dataset and 98.5% for the Pornography dataset.",2158-107X,2156-5570,,1415-1425, ,  ,

This dataset was meticulously curated to facilitate the exploration of harmful online phenomena such as cyberbullying and hate speech, which have exhibited a significant surge both within the Polish Internet as well as globally. The dataset was systematically collected and then annotated using two approaches. First, it was annotated by two proficient layperson volunteers, operating under the guidance of a specialist in the language of cyberbullying and hate speech. To enhance the precision of the annotations, a secondary round of annotations was carried out by a team of adept annotators with specialized long-term expertise in cyberbullying and hate speech annotations. This second phase was further overseen by an experienced annotator, acting as a super-annotator. In its initial application, the dataset was leveraged for the categorization of cyberbullying instances in the Polish language. Specifically, the dataset serves as the foundation for two distinct tasks: (1) a binary classification that segregates harmful and non-harmful messages and (2) a multi-class classification that distinguishes between two variations of harmful content (cyberbullying and hate speech), as well as a non-harmful category. Alongside the dataset itself, we also provide the models that showed satisfying classification performance.

This has also led to an increase in misuse of these platforms to spread hatred in the society. The stats show that most of the cyberbullying happens on social media platforms like Facebook, WhatsApp, etc. The Hatred speech was used for spreading hatred against specific persons, communities, etc. It is necessary to check for the hate speech on social media platforms before it can lead to damaging the peace situation. Automating the task of hate speech detection is a very important step in mitigating this issue as such contents can be quickly acted upon before it spreads hatred. In this paper, we are proposing an Automated Hate speech identification system. The datasets are obtained from HASOC which stands for Hate Speech and Offensive Content Identification in Indo-European Languages, for sub-task b to classify into one of the four categories, Hate, Profane, Offensive, or None for English and Hindi languages. The experiments are carried out to compare the performance of Bert-based architecture with conventional deep learning architectures including CNN (Convolution Neural Network) architecture for English subtask and for Hindi Subtask we fine-tuned the Bert model which gave better results than conventional solutions. We obtained 75.41% accuracy with BERT-based fine tuning better than baseline methods LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) with 41% accuracy for Hindi dataset and for English dataset, we achieved an accuracy of 82.92% compared to 81.57% with baseline models.",2194-5357,2194-5365,978-981-97-1548-0; 978-981-97-1549-7,3-17, , 27th International Symposium on Frontiers of Research in Speech and Music (FRSM)27th International Symposium on Frontiers of Research in Speech and Music (FRSM) ,

The investigated government was elected in 2018, in one of the most polarized elections in Brazilian history, and social media played a prominent role in this polarization. Not far from that, the PCI also generated a great popular commotion on social media networks. This paper aims to analyze the public debate related to the PCI of COVID on Twitter, identifying groups, examining their characteristics and interactions, and verifying evidence of political polarization in this social network. For this, we collected 3,397,933 tweets over a period of 26 weeks, and analyzed four distinct networks, based on different types of users interactions, to identify the main actors and verify the presence of segregated groups. In addition, we use natural language preprocessing to detect group characteristics and toxic speech. As a result, we identified three users groups, based on their use of hashtags and using a community detection technique. The group against the PCI is made up of conservatives and supporters of the government targeted by the investigations and presents the highest internal homogeneity. The other two groups, moderated users and opposed to the government, are formed by actors from the most varied political spectrum, containing users from the political left, center, and right, in addition to the main media outlets in the country. Moreover, other evidences of political polarization were found even in less segregated networks, where users from different groups interact with each other, but with the presence of toxic speech.",,,978-1-4503-9409-3,99-107, , 28th Brazilian Symposium on Multimedia and the Web (WebMedia)28th Brazilian Symposium on Multimedia and the Web (WebMedia) ,

However, their training process invariably exposes them to a diverse range of harmful or toxic content, posing significant challenges in ensuring that LLM responses align with human ethical values. Consequently, the detection and quantification of adverse content remains a paramount issue in contemporary research. In this paper, we introduce the SAFE dataset, a novel resource designed to advance safety assessment research in LLMs. Our dataset extends beyond the binary categorization of content into safe and unsafe. Drawing upon human interpretations of safety, we further delineate unsafe content into six granular categories: Sensitivity, Harmfulness, Falsehood, Information Corruption, Unnaturalness, and Deviation from Instructions. This refined classification aims to enhance LLMs' ability to discern unsafe data more accurately. In total, we have created a dataset comprising 52,340 instruction-response pairs, each annotated with safety meta-tags. Additionally, we have compiled expert comparative assessments for these indicators. We developed a multi-expert rating model trained on the SAFE dataset, designed to evaluate the responses of LLMs across various dimensions. This approach highlights the potential of our dataset in the realm of safety assessment for LLMs. The model's capability to provide multi-faceted evaluations reflects an advanced understanding of the nuanced requirements in LLM response assessment. We believe this dataset represents a valuable resource for the community, contributing to the safe development and deployment of LLMs. Our findings and resources are poised to fuel future research endeavors in this domain.",2169-3536,,,64717-64726, ,  ,

It is crucial to prevent hate speech since it may have serious adverse effects on both society and individuals. Therefore, it is not only important for models to detect these speeches but to also output explanations of why a given text is toxic. While plenty of research is going on to detect online hate speech in English, there is very little research on low-resource languages like Hindi and the explainability aspect of hate speech. Recent laws like the right to explanations of the General Data Protection Regulation have spurred research in developing interpretable models rather than only focusing on performance. Motivated by this, we create the first interpretable benchmark hate speech corpus hate speech explanation (HHES) in the Hindi language, where each hate post has its stereotypical bias and target group category. Providing descriptions of internal stereotypical bias as an explanation of hate posts makes a hate speech detection model more trustworthy. Current work proposes a commonsense-aware unified generative framework, CGenEx, by reframing the multitask problem as a text-to-text generation task. The novelty of this framework is it can solve two different categories of tasks (generation and classification) simultaneously. We establish the efficacy of our proposed model (CGenEx-fuse) on various evaluation metrics over other baselines when applied to the Hindi HHES dataset.Disclaimer The article contains profanity, an inevitable situation for the nature of the work involved.

This study provides an in-depth review of the current state of cyanotoxins and the distribution of CyanoHABs species in Brazil, while also detailing the methods used for their detection. Four hundred and twenty-one incidents were analyzed from 1993 to 2021, compiling cyanotoxin records and toxic CyanoHABs occurrences. The investigation begins with the first detection of microcystins in 1994 and highlights pivotal moments, like the 1996 Caruaru Syndrome  outbreak. This event encouraged research and updated cyanotoxin-monitoring guidelines. The Brazilian drought period of 2015 -2016 exacerbated cyanobacterial growth and saxitoxin levels, coinciding with Zika-related microcephaly. This study delves into methods used for cyanotoxin analysis, including ELISA, bioassays, HPLC, and LC -MS. Additionally, we investigated the toxicity of 37 cyanobacterial strains isolated from various Brazilian environments. Extracts were tested against Artemia salina and analyzed by LC -MS. Results revealed toxicity in extracts from 49 % of cyanobacterial strains. LC -MS results were analyzed using GNPS MS/MS molecular networking for comparing experimental spectra with those of cyanotoxin standards against in-house databases and the existing literature. Our research underscores the variability in cyanotoxin production among species and over time, extending beyond microcystins. LC -MS re- sults, interpreted through the GNPS platform, revealed six cyanotoxin groups in Brazilian strains. Yet, com- pounds present in 75 % of the toxic extracts remained unidentified. Further research is crucial for fully comprehending the impact of potentially harmful organisms on water quality and public health management strategies.

However, when using algorithms to create personas from social media user data, the resulting personas may contain toxic quotes that negatively affect content creators’ perceptions of the personas. To address this issue, we have implemented toxicity detection in an algorithmic persona generation system capable of using tens of millions of social media interactions and user comments for persona creation. On the system's user interface, we provide a feature for content creators using the personas to turn on or off toxic quotes, depending on their preferences. To investigate the feasibility of this feature, we conducted a study with 50 professionals in the online publishing domain. The results show varied reactions, including hate-filter critics, hate-filter advocates, and those in between. Although personal preferences play a role, the usefulness of toxicity filtering appears primarily driven by the work task – specifically the type and topic of stories the content creator seeks to create. We identify six use cases where a toxicity filter is beneficial. For system development, the results imply that it is beneficial to give content creators the option to view or not view toxic comments, rather than making this decision in their stead. We also discuss the ethical implications of removing toxic quotes in algorithmically generated personas, including potentially biasing the user representation.",,,9781450396998.0,,Association for Computing Machinery ,Nordic Human-Computer Interaction Conference  ,

These models are trained on datasets annotated by human raters. We explore how raters' self-described identities impact how they annotate toxicity in online comments. We first define the concept of Specialized Rater Pools: rater pools formed based on raters' self-described identities, rather than at random. We formed three such rater pools for this study - specialized rater pools of raters from the U.S. who identify as African American, LGBTQ, and those who identify as neither. Each of these rater pools annotated the same set of comments, which contains many references to these identity groups. We found that rater identity is a statistically significant factor in how raters will annotate toxicity for identity-related annotations. Using preliminary content analysis, we examined the comments with the most disagreement between rater pools and found nuanced differences in the toxicity annotations. Next, we trained models on the annotations from each of the different rater pools, and compared the scores of these models on comments from several test sets. Finally, we discuss how using raters that self-identify with the subjects of comments can create more inclusive machine learning models, and provide more nuanced ratings than those by random raters.",,,,,Association for Computing Machinery Proc.

If so, what are the behavioral factors that will help machine learning to discover the unknown relationship between gameplay and toxic behavior? In this initial study, we examine whether it is possible to predict toxicity in the MOBA gameFor Honor by observing in-game behavior for players that have been labeled as toxic (i.e. players that have been sanctioned by Ubisoft community managers). We test our hypothesis of detecting toxicity through gameplay with a dataset of almost 1,800 sanctioned players, and comparing these sanctioned players with unsanctioned players. Sanctioned players are defined by their toxic action type (offensive behavior vs. unfair advantage) and degree of severity (warned vs. banned). Our findings, based on supervised learning with random forests, suggest that it is not only possible to behaviorally distinguish sanctioned from unsanctioned players based on selected features of gameplay; it is also possible to predict both the sanction severity (warned vs. banned) and the sanction type (offensive behavior vs. unfair advantage). In particular, all random forest models predict toxicity, its severity, and type, with an accuracy of at least 82%, on average, on unseen players. This research shows that observing in-game behavior can support the work of community managers in moderating and possibly containing the burden of toxic behavior.",,,,,Association for Computing Machinery Proc.

In this research, we design two metrics to identify toxic user types: F score that captures the changes in a user’s toxicity, and G score that captures the direction of the shift taking place in the user’s toxicity pattern. We apply these metrics to a dataset of 4M user comments from Reddit by defining four toxic user types based on the toxicity scores of a user’s comments: (a) Steady Users whose toxicity scores are steady over time, (b) Fickle-Minded Users that switch between toxic and non-toxic commenting, (c) Pacified Users whose commenting becomes less toxic in time, and (d) Radicalized Users that become gradually toxic. Findings from the Reddit dataset indicate that fickle-minded users form the largest group (31.2%), followed by pacified (25.8%), radicalized (25.4%), and steadily toxic users (17.6%). The results suggest that the most typical behavior type of toxicity is switching between toxic and non-toxic commenting. This research has implications for preserving the user-friendliness of online communities by identifying continuously toxic users and users in danger of becoming radicalized (in terms of their toxic behavior), and designing interventions to mitigate these behavior types. Using the metrics we have defined, identifying these user types becomes possible.

Though, determining the DILI potentiality is still challenging due to its low occurrences and unexpected contradicts with clinical animal studies.There have been a variety of efforts and experiments on constructing prediction models to identify compounds that cause liver toxicity. However, the discriminant power of the previous models is not confident enough. Also, studies often relies on experimental data for better accuracy which can cause data access limitation and time consuming works. Therefore, some researchers started concerning compound properties and its molecular structures.In this study, we developed a classification model using liver toxicity related compounds as training set. We acquired 192 toxin data and 187 DILI-negative drugs. We obtained toxin data related to liver toxicity from two databases; Hazardous Substances Data Bank (HSDB) [1] , Toxin and Toxin Target Database (T3DB) [2; 4].

Numerous examples exist of drugs that have had to be withdrawn, because of unacceptable toxicity, in clinical trials and even after reaching the market. In this study phytochemicals from selected spices were used to predict their rodent carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, PPB and BBB. Out of 108 compounds analysed, we found that only five compounds as non-mutagenic and non-carcinogenic and all the remaining were toxic in a pharmacological perspective. The five non-toxic compounds are alpha-zingiberene, delphinidin, laurotetanine, malabaricone-B and malabaricone-C. The PPB values of alpha-zingiberene, delphinidin and laurotetanine are in the <90% range (57.58, 88.41, 52.59, respectively) indicating that the three compounds were weakly bound to plasma proteins and the other two (malabaricone-B and malabaricone-C) strongly binds to plasma protein.

Drug induced liver injury (DILI) has a detrimental impact on human health and remains a leading cause for drug attrition [1]. Toxicogenomics (TGx) has enhanced drug testing and safety prediction, by providing valuable mechanistic insights [2]. Since there are several mechanisms that result in the toxicity endpoint of DILI, the gene expression profiles are diverse, which presents challenges when building TGx signatures for DILI. Thus, compounds with similar characteristics must be used to form a strong expression profile. In this case study, we propose an innovative approach, where each compound's primary and secondary targets and their gene regulatory network (GRN) information is used to inform similar DILI mechanisms. We built a computational pipeline to define each compound's GRN profile and group compounds with similar profiles. This matrix of compounds' GRNs was then transformed using various data transformation and dimension reduction methods. Then, the compounds were clustered into groups based on similarities in their GRN. A DILI predictive machine learning model was built from these groups to identify signature genes and predict DILI from gene expression data. Fitting such models by cluster analysis resulted in a higher accuracy, sensitivity and specificity in compound predictions compared to fitting one model with all compounds. Furthermore, gene set enrichment analysis was performed to identify notable genes in the prediction process to build strong gene signatures for liver toxicity.",,,,,Association for Computing Machinery ,"Proceedings of the 14th ACM International Conference on Bioinformatics, Computational Biology, and Health Informatics  ","drug induced liver injury, machine learning, toxicogenomics, gene regulatory network"

Players' coping strategies are limited to tools that focus on punishing toxic players (e.g., muting, blocking, reporting), which are inadequate and often misused. To address the needs of players experiencing toxicity, we took inspiration from research in other online spaces that provide support tools for targets of harassment. We iteratively designed and evaluated in-game tools to support targets of toxicity. While we found that most players prefer tools that explicitly address toxicity and increase feelings of control, we also found that tools that solely provide social or emotional support also decrease stress, increase feelings of control, and increase positive affect. Our findings suggest that players may benefit from variety in toxicity support tools that both explicitly address toxicity in the moment and help players cope after it has occurred.",,,,,Association for Computing Machinery Proc.

It is unclear if the mechanisms contributing to the adverse effects are similar or unique when comparing different MWCNT. We hypothesize that machine learning techniques applied to toxicity outcomes will distinguish between convergent and divergent molecular responses. Towards this goal, a panel of proteins measured by multi-plex technology in bronchoalveolar lavage collected 1, 28, and 84 d post-exposure from mice exposed to two different as-produced MWCNT, their polymer coated counterparts, or a well-studied reference material, MWCNT-7, were analyzed using association rule mining (ARM) and support vector machine (SVM) techniques. The main objective was to take advantage of both knowledge represented by class association rules and the power of SVM to identify a small number of highly predictive markers (4 to 7 protein panels out of a total 63 proteins) that can distinguish between exposed and unexposed animals. Using these approaches, we were able to reliably (78% -- 97%) identify a small subset of proteins for each exposure that clearly distinguishes effect of exposure. One mediator in particular, MDC/CCL22, was associated with all exposures. MDC protein levels have been shown to be very sensitive in determining MWCNT exposure and predict declining lung function in humans following particulate exposure. Additional mediators (e.g., VEGF-A, MIP1b) exhibited similarity while others (e.g., LIF, MMP-9, VCAM1, PAI-1) distinguished one exposure from another. In vivo toxicity studies indicate that polymer coating the MWCNT for downstream applications can affect pulmonary toxicity. The machine learning techniques clearly distinguished the polymer coated MWCNT from the as-produced counterpart with up to 96% reliability, depending on particle type and exposure duration. The identified patterns in altered lavage proteins may serve as valuable markers to guide detection of exposure to MWCNT and offer hypothesis for future study design. The approaches presented in this study could enable comparison not only within a class of engineered nanomaterials but between various classes of nanomaterials.",,,9781450342254.0,,Association for Computing Machinery ,"Proceedings of the 7th ACM International Conference on Bioinformatics, Computational Biology, and Health Informatics  ","MWCNT toxicity, Nanotoxicity models, support vector machine, association rule mining"

Engaging in human experts to label can be challenging. Semantic understanding can differ from one labeler to another based on individual's language ability. Platforms such as AmazonTurk are not able to ensure the quality of annotations in every domain. Extensive steps such as qualification and counter checking of labels may be implemented which will increase the cost of data annotation. Thus, the higher quality of labelled data expected, the greater the cost that needs to be expended. This scenario is made worse when the language is of low resource where in this work is the Malay language. Malay is a language used mostly in Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and Brunei. Unlike English which has large resources to tap into the semantics of sentences, making automatic labelling faster to mature, resources in Malay language are still limited. Further compounded is the use of social media data where the text is short, unnormalized and the inherent presence of code switching. The availability of qualified native Malay labelers is also scarce. To overcome this, we devised a method to automatically label a total of 219,444 Malay tweets by using a combination of sentiment, emotion and toxicity polarities. We extend the work from Arslan et al. who proposed the use of sentiment and emotion to identify cyberbullying text. Our work added toxicity polarity in the context of automatic labelling of cyberbully tweets in Malay. We were able to employ 5 experts with formal degrees in Malay language to label our training set. We applied this method to Malay cyberbullying corpus to determine “bully” and “not bully” labels.

To illustrate this, we examine three tweets by drawing upon these frameworks. These tweets showcase the racist, sexist, and abusive language used in threats towards those who have been marginalized. Through our analysis, we highlight how content moderation policies, despite their stated goal of promoting free speech, in effect, work to inhibit it by fostering an online toxic environment that precipitates self-censorship in fear of violence and retaliation.

This is not a trivial task as state-of-the-art chatbot models are trained on large, public datasets openly collected from the Internet. This paper presents a first-of-its-kind, large-scale measurement of toxicity in chatbots. We show that publicly available chatbots are prone to providing toxic responses when fed toxic queries. Even more worryingly, some non-toxic queries can trigger toxic responses too. We then set out to design and experiment with an attack, ToxicBuddy, which relies on fine-tuning GPT-2 to generate non-toxic queries that make chatbots respond in a toxic manner. Our extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that our attack is effective against public chatbot models and outperforms manually-crafted malicious queries proposed by previous work. We also evaluate three defense mechanisms against ToxicBuddy, showing that they either reduce the attack performance at the cost of affecting the chatbot's utility or are only effective at mitigating a portion of the attack. This highlights the need for more research from the computer security and online safety communities to ensure that chatbot models do not hurt their users. Overall, we are confident that ToxicBuddy can be used as an auditing tool and that our work will pave the way toward designing more effective defenses for chatbot safety.",,,9781450394505.0,,Association for Computing Machinery ,Proceedings of the 2022 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security  ,"trustworthy machine learning, online toxicity, dialogue system"

It follows a Pareto-like distribution where most of the toxicity is generated by a very small number of profiles and as such, analyzing and characterizing these “toxic profiles” is critical. Prior research has largely focused on sporadic, event-centric toxic content (i.e., tweets) to characterize toxicity on the platform. Instead, we approach the problem of characterizing toxic content from a profile-centric point of view. We study 143K Twitter profiles and focus on the behavior of the top 1% producers of toxic content on Twitter, based on toxicity scores of their tweets availed by Perspective API. With a total of 293M tweets, spanning 16 years of activity, the longitudinal data allows us to reconstruct the timelines of all profiles involved. We use these timelines to gauge the behavior of the most toxic Twitter profiles compared to the rest of the Twitter population. We study the pattern of tweet posting from highly toxic accounts, based on the frequency and how prolific they are, the nature of hashtags and URLs, profile metadata, and Botometer scores. We find that the highly toxic profiles post coherent and well-articulated content, their tweets keep to a narrow theme with lower diversity in hashtags, URLs, and domains, they are thematically similar to each other, and have a high likelihood of bot-like behavior, likely to have progenitors with intentions to influence, based on high fake followers score.

Kwak H,,,Understanding Toxic Behavior in Online Games,,,10.1145/2567948.2580066 , Conference Paper,2014,"With the remarkable advances from isolated console games to massively multi-player online role-playing games, the online gaming world provides yet another place where people interact with each other. Online games have attracted attention from researchers, because i) the purpose of actions is relatively clear, and ii) actions are quantifiable. A wide range of predefined actions for supporting social interaction (e.g., friendship, communication, trade, enmity, aggression, and punishment) reflects either positive or negative connotations among game players, and is unobtrusively recorded by the game servers. These rich electronic footprints have become invaluable assets for the research of social dynamics.In particular, exploring negative behavior in online games is a key research direction because it directly influences gaming experience and user satisfaction. Even a few negative players can impact many others because of the design of multi-player games. For this reason these players are called toxic. The definition of toxic play is not cut and dry. Even if someone follows the game rules, he could be considered toxic. For example, killing one player repetitively is often deemed toxic behavior, although it does not break game rules at all. The vagueness of toxicity makes it hard to understand, detect, and prevent it.League of Legends (LoL), created by Riot Games with 70 million users as of 2012, offers a new way to understand toxic behavior. Riot Games develops a crowdsourcing framework, the Tribunal, to judge whether reported toxic behavior should be punished or not. Volunteered players review user reports and vote for either pardon or punishment. As of March 2013, 105 million votes had been collected in North America and Europe.We explore toxic playing and reaction based on large-scale data from the Tribunal[1]. We collect and investigate over 10 million user reports on 1.46 million toxic players and corresponding crowdsourced decisions made in the Tribunal. We crawl data from three different regions, North America, Western Europe, and Korea, to take regional differences of user behavior into account. To obtain the comprehensive view of toxic playing and reaction based on huge data collection, we answer following research questions in a bottom-up approach: how individuals react to toxic players, how teams interact with toxic players, how general toxic or non-toxic players behave across the match, and how crowds make a decision on toxic players. We find large-scale empirical support for some notoriously difficult theories to test in the wild, which are bystander effect, ingroup favoritism, black sheep effect, cohesion-performance relationships, and attribution theory. We also discover that regional differences affect the likelihood of being reported and the proportion of being punished of toxic players in the Tribunal.We then propose a supervised learning approach for predicting crowdsourced decisions on toxic behavior with large-scale labeled data collections[2]. Using the same sparse information available to the reviewers, we trained classifiers to detect the presence, and severity of toxicity. We built several models oriented around in-game performance, reports by victims of toxic behavior, and linguistic features of chat messages. We found that training with high agreement decisions resulted in more accuracy on low agreement decisions and that our classifier was adept in detecting clear cut innocence. Finally, we showed that our classifier is relatively robust across cultural regions; our classifier built from a North American dataset performed adequately on a European dataset.Ultimately, our work can be used as a foundation for the further study of toxic behavior.",,,9781450327459.0,,Association for Computing Machinery ,Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on World Wide Web  ,"online video games, toxic behavior, league of legends, machine learning, crowdsourcing"

In this work, we employ this approach to discover toxic comments in a large pool of documents provided by a current Kaggle's competition regarding Wikipedia's talk page edits.

Diamond M,,,The Story of Toxic Chemicals in Computing Systems,,,10.1145/3080556.3080570 , Conference Paper,2017,"Protecting human and environmental health from the effects of toxic chemicals is an element of sustainability efforts and respecting global biophysical limits. Can this goal be achieved with respect to toxic chemicals used in computing systems? It is likely no surprise that achieving this goal is a wicked problem characterized by multiple disciplinary silos, knowledge gaps, competing priorities and vested interests, problems between organizational boundaries, the need to change human behavior and economic imperatives, and the unintended consequences of solutions. This talk unpacks the challenge of protecting human and environmental health with respect to (only) one set of chemicals used in computing systems, namely organic flame retardants (FRs). I chose FRs because they are used in all computing system hardware (e.g., cell phones, computer cases, printed circuit boards, wiring), but they migrate from their source polymer with disposition in global human and ecosystem populations. Studies continue to emerge that link exposure to specific FRs with adverse health effects including loss of IQ points and other neurological and neurobehavioral effects, and reproductive effects.The story unfolds with one family of flame retardants (polybrominated diphenyl ethers or PBDEs) that are found globally in human and ecosystem populations and that have been associated with adverse health impacts. PBDEs were widely used in the exterior cases and wiring of computing systems, as well as other uses such as the foam of upholstered furniture. The major source of human exposure was considered to be foam-containing products. In North America, controls on new uses were implemented for two PBDE formulations in 2004 and a third formulation in 2013 due to their toxicity and persistence. This resulted in decreasing concentrations in most environments with the important exception of those handling a poorly quantified mass of e-waste in developed and developing countries. Here, e-waste will continue to be a source of exposure to PBDEs for at least the next decade. A secondary source of exposure to PBDEs comes from new products (e.g., my plastic kitchen spoons) that were presumably manufactured from recycled PBDE-containing polymers such as computer cases.",,,9781450349505.0,,Association for Computing Machinery ,Proceedings of the 2017 Workshop on Computing Within Limits  ,keynote talk

Meanwhile, interventions that promote positive interactions and proactively create positive gaming spaces are still in their infancy; little is known about how players respond to positivity. In our study, 959 League of Legends players were presented with either 10 positive chat logs or 10 negative chat logs, and asked to reflect on the content and how representative such communication is of their own gaming experiences. We thematically coded participants' free-form answers (identifying the themes normalize, acknowledge, downplay, cope, blame, and make personal), and compared the positive and negative conditions in terms of theme prevalence. Our findings show that participants were more likely to normalize and acknowledge toxic negativity than positivity. Furthermore, the dominant response to positivity consisted of downplaying messages as not representative and rare, and even expressing suspicion that messages must have been fabricated or intended as sarcasm. Participants overwhelmingly cope by muting chat, protecting them from toxic interactions, but leaving them unexposed to positive communication and other beneficial social interactions within play.",,,,,Association for Computing Machinery Proc.

Here we investigate downstream consequences of social corrections on users’ subsequent sharing of other content. Being corrected might make users more attentive to accuracy, thus improving their subsequent sharing. Alternatively, corrections might not improve subsequent sharing - or even backfire - by making users feel defensive, or by shifting their attention away from accuracy (e.g., towards various social factors). We identified N=2,000 users who shared false political news on Twitter, and replied to their false tweets with links to fact-checking websites. We find causal evidence that being corrected decreases the quality, and increases the partisan slant and language toxicity, of the users’ subsequent retweets (but has no significant effect on primary tweets). This suggests that being publicly corrected by another user shifts one's attention away from accuracy - presenting an important challenge for social correction approaches.",,,9781450380966.0,,Association for Computing Machinery ,Proceedings of the 2021 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems  ,"social media, fake news, correction, Misinformation"

Zhang T,,,Deep-Learning-Based Automated Scoring for the Severity of Toxic Comments Using Electra,,,10.1145/3556677.3556693 , Conference Paper,2022,"With the increasing popularity of the Internet, social media plays a crucial role in people's daily communication. However, due to the anonymity of Internet, toxic comments emerge in an endless stream on the Internet, which seriously affects the health of online social environment. To effectively reduce the impact of toxic comments, automated scoring methods for the severity of toxic comments are in great demand. For that purpose, a deep-learning-based natural language processing technique is proposed using ELECTRA to automatically score the toxicity of a comment in this work. The backbone of our model is the ELECTRA discriminator, and the downstream regression task is accomplished by the following head layer. Three head layers are implemented separately: multi-layer perceptron, convolutional neural network, and attention. The dataset used for model training is from the Kaggle competition Toxic Comment Classification Challenge, and the model performance is evaluated through another Kaggle competition Jigsaw Rate Severity of Toxic Comments. By a boost from the K-Fold cross validation and an ensemble of three models with different head layers, our method can reach a competition score 0.80343. Such score ranks 71/2301 (top 3.1%) in the leaderboard and can get a silver medal in the competition. The results in this work would help filter the toxic comments and harmful text information automatically and effectively on the Internet, and could greatly reduce the cost of manual review and help build a healthier Internet environment.",,,9781450396936.0,,Association for Computing Machinery ,Proceedings of the 2022 6th International Conference on Deep Learning Technologies  ,"Kaggle, ELECTRA, Transformer, Toxic comment, Deep learning"

C. perfringens is one of the most common causes of food poisoning illness and has a high mortality rate. As a growth factor, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor helps immune system maintain the balanced numbers of neutrophils when we are infected by pathogens. Clostridium perfringens alpha toxin promotes the formation of G-CSF. During the bacterial infection, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is sensed through a Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)-dependent pathway. This leads to the increased secretion of G-CSF into the systemic circulation which accelerated the proliferation and differentiation of neutrophils. However, Clostridium perfringens impairs the granulopoiesis by decreasing the surface expression of neutrophil Ly6G+. The study will use mice, which were separate into positive control groups with C. perfringens injection and negative control group with phosphate-buffered saline. Employing a variety of procedures and methods, in vivo, such as FACS and ELISA, the paper investigates whether C. perfringens alpha toxin would inhibit granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, impairing granulopoiesis and inhibiting G-CSF-mediated cell proliferation of Ly6G+ neutrophils in a productive and effective way.",,,9781450398442.0,,Association for Computing Machinery ,Proceedings of the 3rd International Symposium on Artificial Intelligence for Medicine Sciences  ,"Ly6G+, G-CSF, Clostridium perfringens, neutrophils, alpha toxin"

A control vector parameterization method was used to optimize a realistic intra-dialytic exercise profile. During exercise, QC and KC were allowed to vary between their nominal values and 100% and 400% increase, respectively. Initial simulation suggested that during exercise, QC and KC reaches their maximum permissible values, thus only timings of exercise implementation were considered as decision variables in optimization. Results from the simulation study reveal that during the 3 bouts of optimal intermittent exercise, remotely sequestered solutes can be removed from the low flow region.

For that purpose, datasets generated by high-throughput technologies (e.g., high-throughput/content screening) combined with various omics data types are now generated in vitro to test large and diverse set of chemicals (e.g. ToxCast). The development of relevant computational approaches for the analysis and integration of these big data remains challenging and requires qualitative and quantitative evaluation. The current scope of sbv IMPROVER (Industrial Methodology for Process Verification in Research; http://sbvimprover.com) is the verification of methods and concepts in systems biology research via challenges opened to the scientific community. Previous challenges brought new insights on methods and their associated results that address questions about diagnostic signatures, the translatability of biological responses/processes across species, and the relevance of biological causal network models. A new sbv IMPROVER challenge will be introduced aiming at evaluating (i) methodologies for the identification of specific biomarkers of exposure and (ii) the predictability by omics data of toxicity mechanisms when cells/tissues in vitro or whole organisms are exposed to individual chemical molecules or mixtures. Participants will be provided with high quality data sets to develop predictive models/classifiers. For this challenge, the integration of a priori biological knowledge in the development of computational approaches may be required to enable biological interpretability/understanding of the predictions.

Recent work has shown some proofs-of-concept of Large language Models’ (LLMs) ability to generate cross-domain analogies. However, the reliability and potential usefulness of this capacity for augmenting human creative work has received little systematic exploration. In this paper, we systematically explore LLMs capacity to augment cross-domain analogical reasoning. Across three studies, we found: 1) LLM-generated cross-domain analogies were frequently judged as helpful in the context of a problem reformulation task (median 4 out of 5 helpfulness rating), and frequently (∼ 80% of cases) led to observable changes in problem formulations, and 2) there was an upper bound of ∼ 25% of outputs being rated as potentially harmful, with a majority due to potentially upsetting content, rather than biased or toxic content. These results demonstrate the potential utility — and risks — of LLMs for augmenting cross-domain analogical creativity.",,,,,Association for Computing Machinery ,Proceedings of the 15th Conference on Creativity and Cognition  ,"Large Language Models, Analogy, Creativity Support Tools"

Specifically, the current video encoders tend to holistically embed all video clues at different granularities in a hierarchical manner, which inevitably introducesneighboring-frame redundancy that can overwhelm detailed visual clues at the object level. Subsequently, prevailing vision-language fusion designs introduce thecross-modal redundancy by exhaustively fusing all visual elements with question tokens without explicitly differentiating their pairwise vision-language interactions, thus making a pernicious impact on the answering. To this end, we propose a novel transformer-based architecture, that aims to model VideoQA in a redundancy-aware manner. To address the neighboring-frame redundancy, we introduce a video encoder structure that emphasizes the object-level change in neighboring frames, while adopting an out-of-neighboring message-passing scheme that imposes attention only on distant frames. As for the cross-modal redundancy, we equip our fusion module with a novel adaptive sampling, which explicitly differentiates the vision-language interactions by identifying a small subset of visual elements that exclusively support the answer. Upon these advancements, we find this underlineR edundancy-underlinea ware transunderlineformer (RaFormer) can achieve state-of-the-art results on multiple VideoQA benchmarks.",,,,,Association for Computing Machinery ,Proceedings of the 31st ACM International Conference on Multimedia  ,"video question answering, video-language"

Climate change is threatening the health of the planet and humanity. Public engagement is critical to address climate change. However, climate change conversations on Twitter tend to polarize beliefs, leading to misinformation and fake news that influence public attitudes, often dividing them into climate change believers and deniers. Our paper proposes an approach to classify the attitude of climate change tweets (believe/deny/ambiguous) to identify denier statements on Twitter. Most existing approaches for detecting stances and classifying climate change tweets either overlook deniers’ tweets or do not have a suitable architecture. The relevant literature suggests that emotions and higher levels of toxicity are prevalent in climate change Twitter conversations, leading to a delay in appropriate climate action. Therefore, our work focuses on learning stance detection (main task) while exploiting the auxiliary tasks of recognizing emotions and offensive utterances. We propose a multimodal multitasking framework MEMOCLiC that captures the input data using different embedding techniques and attention frameworks, and then incorporates the learned emotional and offensive expressions to obtain an overall representation of the features relevant to the stance of the input tweet.

In scenarios like disaster management and homeland security, in case some of the sensors dispersed in a larger geographic area report a value higher than a certain threshold, one may want to ensure a quality of the readings for the affected region. This, in turn, implies that one may want to ensure that there are enough sensors there and, consequently, guide a subset of the rest of the sensors towards the affected region.

These devices offer a typical battery life that ranges from several months to several years, which results in two problems. Batteries must be replaced, increasing maintenance costs, and toxic batteries are abandoned, damaging the environment. Recent advances in battery technology have delivered primary batteries with a lifetime of 40 years, however, the average power that can be delivered over the lifetime is extremely limited. Energy harvesting is a promising alternative, however, energy harvesting systems are fragile in the face of power failures, which has prevented their widespread adoption. This paper tackles this problem by introducing the HyPer IoT platform, which delivers a deterministic 40 year battery life, through a combination of energy harvesting and a long life primary battery. To mitigate environmental dynamism, HyPer provides a self-adaptive software stack that matches system performance against available environmental energy. Our evaluations show that HyPer reliably achieves a 40 year battery lifetime, with a task schedulability of close to 95.4% of the available energy, while energy harvesting significantly improves performance in comparison to batteries alone.",,,9781450387583.0,,Association for Computing Machinery ,Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on the Internet of Things  ,"sustainability, adaptive systems, energy efficiency, energy harvesting, internet of things (IoT)"

However, there are well-known barriers to computing in higher education: a male-dominated field, toxic environment, harassment, and the perpetuation of stereotypes that do not attract or retain women, and black and indigenous students. Since several countries introduced computing to elementary and secondary curricula in the past decade, it is paramount to investigate if and how the existing barriers in higher education propagate at those educational levels. In this lightning talk, we are particularly interested in collaborations to investigate how the Sense of Belonging and Self-efficacy change over time in cohorts where computing education is mandatory nationwide or in a specific educational system. We aim to gather empirical data using validated instruments to evaluate the Sense of Belonging and Self-efficacy, analyze if such measurements vary across gender and socioeconomic status, and conduct in-depth interviews to understand how perceptions of computing change over time.

However, recent discoveries show many species of bacteria communicate in order to perform tasks previously thought to be limited to multicellular organisms. Central to this capability is quorum sensing, whereby organisms detect cell density and use this information to trigger group behaviors. Quorum sensing is used by bacteria in the formation of biofilms, secretion of digestive enzymes and, in the case of pathogenic bacteria, release of toxins or other virulence factors. Indeed, methods to disrupt quorum sensing are currently being investigated as possible treatments for numerous diseases, including cystic fibrosis, epidemic cholera, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. In this paper we demonstrate the evolution of a quorum sensing behavior in populations of digital organisms. Specifically, we show that digital organisms are capable of evolving a strategy to collectively suppress self-replication, when the population density reaches a specific, evolved threshold. We present the evolved genome of an organism exhibiting this behavior and analyze the collective operation of this algorithm. Finally, through a set of experiments we demonstrate that the behavior scales to populations up to 400 times larger than those in which the behavior evolved.",,,9781605583259.0,,Association for Computing Machinery ,Proceedings of the 11th Annual Conference on Genetic and Evolutionary Computation  ,"artificial life, cooperative behavior, quorum sensing, self-organization, digital evolution, multi-agent system"

In this paper, we focus on the evidence-based fake news detection, where several evidences are utilized to probe the veracity of news (i.e., a claim). Most previous methods first employ sequential models to embed the semantic information and then capture the claim-evidence interaction based on different attention mechanisms. Despite their effectiveness, they still suffer from two main weaknesses. Firstly, due to the inherent drawbacks of sequential models, they fail to integrate the relevant information that is scattered far apart in evidences for veracity checking. Secondly, they neglect much redundant information contained in evidences that may be useless or even harmful. To solve these problems, we propose a unified Graph-based sEmantic sTructure mining framework, namely GET in short. Specifically, different from the existing work that treats claims and evidences as sequences, we model them as graph-structured data and capture the long-distance semantic dependency among dispersed relevant snippets via neighborhood propagation. After obtaining contextual semantic information, our model reduces information redundancy by performing graph structure learning. Finally, the fine-grained semantic representations are fed into the downstream claim-evidence interaction module for predictions.

These resources help users understand S&P technologies and tools and suggest actionable strategies. Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as trusted information sources. However, their accuracy and correctness have been called into question. Prior research has outlined the shortcomings of LLMs in answering multiple-choice questions and user ability to inadvertently circumvent model restrictions (e.g., to produce toxic content). Yet, the ability of LLMs to provide reliable S&P advice is not well-explored. In this paper, we measure their ability to refute popular S&P misconceptions that the general public holds. We first study recent academic literature to curate a dataset of over a hundred S&P-related misconceptions across six different topics. We then query two popular LLMs (Bard and ChatGPT) and develop a labeling guide to evaluate their responses to these misconceptions. To comprehensively evaluate their responses, we further apply three strategies: query each misconception multiple times, generate and query their paraphrases, and solicit source URLs of the responses. Both models demonstrate, on average, a 21.3% non-negligible error rate, incorrectly supporting popular S&P misconceptions. The error rate increases to 32.6% when we repeatedly query LLMs with the same or paraphrased misconceptions. We also expose that models may partially support a misconception or remain noncommittal, refusing a firm stance on misconceptions. Our exploration of information sources for responses revealed that LLMs are susceptible to providing invalid URLs ( for Bard and for ChatGPT) or point to unrelated sources ( returned by Bard and by ChatGPT). Our findings highlight that existing LLMs are not completely reliable for S&P advice and motivate future work in understanding how users can better interact with this technology.",,,,,Association for Computing Machinery ,Proceedings of the 39th Annual Computer Security Applications Conference  ,"misconception, security and privacy advice, Large language models"

This pioneering work focuses on addressing imbalanced datasets in toxicity detection by introducing a novel approach to augment toxic language data. We create a balanced dataset by instructing fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) using Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). Recognizing the challenges in collecting sufficient toxic samples from social media platforms for building a balanced dataset, our methodology involves sentence-level text data augmentation through paraphrasing existing samples using optimized generative LLMs. Leveraging generative LLM, we utilize the Proximal Policy Optimizer (PPO) as the RL algorithm to fine-tune the model further and align it with human feedback. In other words, we start by fine-tuning a LLM using an instruction dataset, specifically tailored for the task of paraphrasing while maintaining semantic consistency. Next, we apply PPO and a reward function, to further fine-tune (optimize) the instruction-tuned LLM. This RL process guides the model in generating toxic responses. We utilize the Google Perspective API as a toxicity evaluator to assess generated responses and assign rewards/penalties accordingly. This approach guides LLMs through PPO and the reward function, transforming minority class samples into augmented versions. The primary goal of our methodology is to create a balanced and diverse dataset to enhance the accuracy and performance of classifiers in identifying instances from the minority class. Utilizing two publicly available toxic datasets, we compared various techniques with our proposed method for generating toxic samples, demonstrating that our approach outperforms all others in producing a higher number of toxic samples. Starting with an initial 16,225 toxic prompts, our method successfully generated 122,951 toxic samples with a toxicity score exceeding 30%. Subsequently, we developed various classifiers using the generated balanced datasets and applied a cost-sensitive learning approach to the original imbalanced dataset. The findings highlight the superior performance of classifiers trained on data generated using our proposed method. These results highlight the importance of employing RL and a data-agnostic model as a reward mechanism for augmenting toxic data, thereby enhancing the robustness of toxicity detection models.",,,,, ,  ,"Text Data Augmentation, Imbalanced Toxic Datasets, Large Language Models, Reinforcement Learning"

Then, we report findings from a survey (n = 85) on players’ experiences with toxicity, how they employ the identified coping strategies, how games support coping, and their general coping styles. Our paper contributes a framework for coping strategies to deal with game-based toxicity and provides insights into the prevalence of these strategies among players and factors that affect their usage and effectiveness. These findings can be used to guide better in-game tools that help players mitigate the harm caused by toxicity.",,,,, ,  Proceedings of the 2024 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,"coping, esports, online games, toxicity"

Both research and practice have developed measures to combat and curb toxicity, yet these actions appear insufficient since negative behaviors persist. In this paper, we examine the relationship between players’ propensity to engage in toxic behaviors and their in-game purchasing behavior. For this, we collected data from 204 League of Legends players and performed a multiple regression analysis using demographics, controls, and toxic behavior as independent variables to explain the dependent variable purchase behavior. This analysis revealed a positive relationship between self-reported toxic behavior and purchase behavior. This finding suggests that while developers may wish to get rid of toxicity, it is not in their financial interests to ban toxic players altogether. This, in part, may explain the persistence and prevalence of toxicity in multiplayer online games. Future research may look into characteristics such as deficient self-regulation as potential explanations for the positive correlation between toxicity and purchase behavior.",,,,, ,  Companion Proceedings of the 2024 Annual Symposium on Computer-Human Interaction in Play,"MOBA, Toxic behavior, demographic and control variables, purchase behavior"

We can discourage social media users from sharing such material by automatically generating interventions that explain why certain content is inappropriate. To bridge this research gap, we propose an innovative task: generating interventions for toxic videos in code-mixed languages which go beyond existing methods focusing on text and images to combat online toxicity. We are introducing a Toxic Code-Mixed Intervention Video benchmark dataset (ToxCMI), comprising 1697 code-mixed toxic video utterances sourced from YouTube. Each utterance in this dataset has been meticulously annotated for toxicity and severity, accompanied by interventions provided in Hindi-English code-mixed languages. We have developed an advanced multimodal framework ToxVI, specifically designed for the task of generating Toxic Video appropriate Interventions, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), which comprises three modules - Modality module, Cross-Modal Synchronization module and Generation module.

A common approach to this issue is developing detection models that rely on human annotations. However, the tasks required to build such models expose annotators to harmful and offensive content and may require significant time and cost to complete. Generative AI models have the potential to understand and detect harmful textual content. We used ChatGPT to investigate this potential and compared its performance with MTurker annotations for three frequently discussed concepts related to harmful textual content on social media: Hateful, Offensive, and Toxic (HOT). We designed five prompts to interact with ChatGPT and conducted four experiments eliciting HOT classifications. Our results show that ChatGPT can achieve an accuracy of approximately 80% when compared to MTurker annotations. Specifically, the model displays a more consistent classification for non-HOT comments than HOT comments compared to human annotations. Our findings also suggest that ChatGPT classifications align with the provided HOT definitions. However, ChatGPT classifies “hateful” and “offensive” as subsets of “toxic.” Moreover, the choice of prompts used to interact with ChatGPT impacts its performance. Based on these insights, our study provides several meaningful implications for employing ChatGPT to detect HOT content, particularly regarding the reliability and consistency of its performance, its understanding and reasoning of the HOT concept, and the impact of prompts on its performance.

In this study, we investigate the presence of bias in harmful speech classification of gender-queer dialect online, focusing specifically on the treatment of reclaimed slurs. We introduce a novel dataset, QueerReclaimLex, based on 109 curated templates exemplifying non-derogatory uses of LGBTQ+ slurs.

We systematically evaluate the performance of five off-the-shelf language models in assessing the harm of these texts and explore the effectiveness of chain-of-thought prompting to teach large language models (LLMs) to leverage author identity context. We reveal a tendency for these models to inaccurately flag texts authored by gender-queer individuals as harmful. Strikingly, across all LLMs the performance is poorest for texts that show signs of being written by individuals targeted by the featured slur (F1 ≤ 0.24).

However, given the ubiquitous topical communities on social media, a trained HSD classifier can easily become biased towards specific targeted groups (e.g.,female andblack people), where a high rate of either false positive or false negative results can significantly impair public trust in the fairness of content moderation mechanisms, and eventually harm the diversity of online society. Although existing fairness-aware HSD methods can smooth out some discrepancies across targeted groups, they are mostly specific to a narrow selection of targets that are assumed to be known and fixed. This inevitably prevents those methods from generalizing to real-world use cases where new targeted groups constantly emerge (e.g., new forums created on Reddit) over time. To tackle the defects of existing HSD practices, we propose &lt;u&gt;Ge&lt;/u&gt;neralizable &lt;u&gt;t&lt;/u&gt;arget-aware &lt;u&gt;Fair&lt;/u&gt;ness (GetFair), a new method for fairly classifying each post that contains diverse and even unseen targets during inference. To remove the HSD classifier's spurious dependence on target-related features, GetFair trains a series of filter functions in an adversarial pipeline, so as to deceive the discriminator that recovers the targeted group from filtered post embeddings. To maintain scalability and generalizability, we innovatively parameterize all filter functions via a hypernetwork. Taking a target's pretrained word embedding as input, the hypernetwork generates the weights used by each target-specific filter on-the-fly without storing dedicated filter parameters. In addition, a novel semantic gap alignment scheme is imposed on the generation process, such that the produced filter function for an unseen target is rectified by its semantic affinity with existing targets used for training. Finally, experiments are conducted on two benchmark HSD datasets, showing advantageous performance of GetFair on out-of-sample targets among baselines.",,,,, ,  Proceedings of the 30th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,"data science for social good, debiased content moderation, hate speech detection, target-aware fairness"

Due to the inherent sender-receiver nature of network behaviors, graph-based frameworks are commonly used for detecting anomalous behaviors. However, in real-world scenarios, the boundary between normal and anomalous behaviors tends to be ambiguous. The local heterophily of graphs interferes with the detection, and existing methods based on nodes or edges introduce unwanted noise into representation results, thereby impacting the effectiveness of detection. To address these issues, we propose PhoGAD, a graph-based anomaly detection framework. PhoGAD leverages persistent homology optimization to clarify behavioral boundaries. Building upon this, the weights of adjacent edges are designed to mitigate the effects of local heterophily. Subsequently, to tackle the noise problem, we conduct a formal analysis and propose a disentangled representation-based explicit embedding method, ultimately achieving anomaly behavior detection. Experiments on intrusion, traffic, and spam datasets verify that PhoGAD has surpassed the performance of state-of-the-art (SOTA) frameworks in detection efficacy. Notably, PhoGAD demonstrates robust detection even with diminished anomaly proportions, highlighting its applicability to real-world scenarios. The analysis of persistent homology demonstrates its effectiveness in capturing the topological structure formed by normal edge features. Additionally, ablation experiments validate the effectiveness of the innovative mechanisms integrated within PhoGAD.",,,,, ,  Proceedings of the 17th ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining,"anomaly detection, behavior detection, graph learning, neural networks, persistent homology"

Nevertheless, these platforms are being increasingly misused to spread toxic content, including hate speech, malicious advertising, and pornography, leading to severe negative consequences such as harm to teenagers' mental health. Despite tremendous efforts in developing and deploying textual and image content moderation methods, malicious users can evade moderation by embedding texts into images, such as screenshots of the text, usually with some interference. We find that modern content moderation software's performance against such malicious inputs remains underexplored. In this work, we propose OASIS, a metamorphic testing framework for content moderation software. OASIS employs 21 transform rules summarized from our pilot study on 5,000 real-world toxic contents collected from 4 popular social media applications, including Twitter, Instagram, Sina Weibo, and Baidu Tieba. Given toxic textual contents, OASIS can generate image test cases, which preserve the toxicity yet are likely to bypass moderation. In the evaluation, we employ OASIS to test five commercial textual content moderation software from famous companies (i.e., Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, Baidu Cloud, Alibaba Cloud and Tencent Cloud), as well as a state-of-the-art moderation research model. The results show that OASIS achieves up to 100% error finding rates.

Battery-free devices represent a probable future for sustainable ubiquitous computing and we will need many more new devices and programmers to bring that future into reality. Yet, energy harvesting and battery-free devices that frequently fail are challenging to program. The maker movement has organically developed a considerable variety of platforms to prototype and program ubiquitous sensing and computing devices, but only a few have been modified to be usable with energy harvesting and to hide those pesky power failures that are the norm from variable energy availability (platforms like Microsoft's Makecode and AdaFruit's CircuitPython). Many platforms, especially Arduino (the first and most famous maker platform), do not support energy harvesting devices and intermittent computing. To bridge this gap and lay a strong foundation for potential new platforms for maker programming, we build a tool called BOOTHAMMER: a lightweight assembly re-writer for ARM Thumb. BOOTHAMMER analyzes and rewrites the low-level assembly to insert careful checkpoint and restore operations to enable programs to persist through power failures. The approach is easily insertable in existing toolchains and is general-purpose enough to be resilient to future platforms and devices/chipsets.

We conduct an extensive evaluation using various program benchmarks with Arduino as our chosen evaluation platform.

Unfortunately, traditional grading practices have been shown to reduce achievement, discourage students, and suppress effort to such an extent that some common elements of traditional grading practices have been termed toxic. Using grades to reward or punish student behavior does not encourage learning and instead increases anxiety and stress. These toxic elements are present throughout computing education and computer science classrooms in the form of late penalties, lack of credit for code that doesn't compile or pass certain unit tests, among others.

The potential for LLMs to generate harmful content is a significant concern. This risk necessitates rigorous testing and comprehensive evaluation of LLMs to ensure safe and responsible use. However, extensive testing of LLMs requires substantial computational resources, making it an expensive endeavor. Therefore, exploring cost-saving strategies during the testing phase is crucial to balance the need for thorough evaluation with the constraints of resource availability. To address this, our approach begins by transferring the moderation knowledge from an LLM to a small model. Subsequently, we deploy two distinct strategies for generating malicious queries: one based on a syntax tree approach, and the other leveraging an LLM-based method. Finally, our approach incorporates a sequential filter-test process designed to identify test cases that are prone to eliciting toxic responses. By doing so, we significantly curtail unnecessary or unproductive interactions with LLMs, thereby streamlining the testing process. Our research evaluated the efficacy of DistillSeq across four LLMs: GPT-3.5, GPT-4.0, Vicuna-13B, and Llama-13B.

Yet, the ability of LLMs to provide reliable S&amp;P advice is not well-explored. In this paper, we measure their ability to refute popular S&amp;P misconceptions that the general public holds. We first study recent academic literature to curate a dataset of over a hundred S&amp;P-related misconceptions across six different topics. We then query two popular LLMs (Bard and ChatGPT) and develop a labeling guide to evaluate their responses to these misconceptions. To comprehensively evaluate their responses, we further apply three strategies: query each misconception multiple times, generate and query their paraphrases, and solicit source URLs of the responses. Both models demonstrate, on average, a 21.3% non-negligible error rate, incorrectly supporting popular S&amp;P misconceptions. The error rate increases to 32.6% when we repeatedly query LLMs with the same or paraphrased misconceptions.

We conducted 19 focus groups, during which 56 participants with disabilities probed a dialog model about disability and discussed and annotated its responses. Participants rarely characterized model outputs as blatantly offensive or toxic. Instead, participants used nuanced language to detail how the dialog model mirrored subtle yet harmful stereotypes they encountered in their lives and dominant media, e.g., inspiration porn and able-bodied saviors. Participants often implicated training data as a cause for these stereotypes and recommended training the model on diverse identities from disability-positive resources.

Transgender and non-binary (TGNB) individuals disproportionately experience discrimination and exclusion from daily life. Given the recent popularity and adoption of language generation technologies, the potential to further marginalize this population only grows. Although a multitude of NLP fairness literature focuses on illuminating and addressing gender biases, assessing gender harms for TGNB identities requires understanding how such identities uniquely interact with societal gender norms and how they differ from gender binary-centric perspectives. Such measurement frameworks inherently require centering TGNB voices to help guide the alignment between gender-inclusive NLP and whom they are intended to serve. Towards this goal, we ground our work in the TGNB community and existing interdisciplinary literature to assess how the social reality surrounding experienced marginalization of TGNB persons contributes to and persists within Open Language Generation (OLG). This social knowledge serves as a guide for evaluating popular large language models (LLMs) on two key aspects: (1) misgendering and (2) harmful responses to gender disclosure. To do this, we introduce TANGO, a dataset of template-based real-world text curated from a TGNB-oriented community. We discover a dominance of binary gender norms reflected by the models; LLMs least misgendered subjects in generated text when triggered by prompts whose subjects used binary pronouns. Meanwhile, misgendering was most prevalent when triggering generation with singular they and neopronouns. When prompted with gender disclosures, TGNB disclosure generated the most stigmatizing language and scored most toxic, on average. Our findings warrant further research on how TGNB harms manifest in LLMs and serve as a broader case study toward concretely grounding the design of gender-inclusive AI in community voices and interdisciplinary literature.",,,,, ,"  Proceedings of the 2023 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency","AI Fairness Auditing, Algorithmic Fairness, Natural Language Generation, Queer Harms in AI"

Due to its popularity, WhatsApp has become a powerful and cheap tool for political campaigning being widely used during the 2019 Indian general election, where it was used to connect to the voters on a large scale. Along with the campaigning, there have been reports that WhatsApp has also become a breeding ground for harmful speech against various protected groups and religious minorities. Many such messages attempt to instil fear among the population about a specific (minority) community. According to research on inter-group conflict, such ‘fear speech’ messages could have a lasting impact and might lead to real offline violence. In this paper, we perform the first large scale study on fear speech across thousands of public WhatsApp groups discussing politics in India. We curate a new dataset and try to characterize fear speech from this dataset. We observe that users writing fear speech messages use various events and symbols to create the illusion of fear among the reader about a target community. We build models to classify fear speech and observe that current state-of-the-art NLP models do not perform well at this task. Fear speech messages tend to spread faster and could potentially go undetected by classifiers built to detect traditional toxic speech due to their low toxic nature. Finally, using a novel methodology to target users with Facebook ads, we conduct a survey among the users of these WhatsApp groups to understand the types of users who consume and share fear speech. We believe that this work opens up new research questions that are very different from tackling hate speech which the research community has been traditionally involved in.

We also investigate commenting activity when an article is posted on either 4chan’s Politically Incorrect board (/pol/) or six selected subreddits. We find statistically significant increases in hateful commenting activity around real-world divisive events like the “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville and political events like the second and third 2016 US presidential debates. Also, we find that articles that attract a substantial number of hateful comments have different linguistic characteristics when compared to articles that do not attract hateful comments.

By extracting keywords from the data set built by yourself, the sequence of keywords is organized into text information that is controlled to be generated. Insert a module into the language model, use this module to make the initial text interact with the control text, and then perform subsequent generation. And two different training tasks are designed so that the model learns how to control text generation by controlling text information while maintaining a high degree of fluency and diversity of text generation.

To further mitigate the training costs, we propose In-context learning Reward Guided Decoding (IRGD), a weighted decoding method that exploits the in-context learning ability of language models as an alternative to additional model fine-tuning. Specifically, IRGD utilizes ICL outputs to score the alignment reward between sequences and target attributes, subsequently modifying the sampling probabilities to favor tokens with higher reward scores. By applying ICL, IRGD adapts to different tasks by simply adjusting task descriptions and demonstration rather than fine-tuning the model.

To overcome this, few works incorporated style-based caption generation that captures the variability in the generated descriptions. This article presents a style embedding-based variational autoencoder for controlled stylized caption generation framework (RFCG+SE-VAE-CSCG).

There are differences in the soft results which may be a limitation on their application. To analyze these differences and lack of robustness, we propose a robust methodology that integrates classical statistical experimental design principles with the these advanced models, aiming to identify statistically significant differences among their outcomes. In particular, an experimental design is presented in which the main factors, levels, treatments and interactions that influence the predictions made by different models of complex natural language processing are identified. The main aim of this research is to better understand the influence of some controlled factors that are used in com-plex natural language processing models by applying classical statistical techniques, providing a comprehensive perspective on the relative effectiveness of different zero-shot classification models. It aims to offer practitioners insights into when and where certain models may be more or less sensitive, facilitating informed decision-making in applying these advanced language models. Additionally, computational results obtained from a pilot dataset are presented. These results illustrate the entire process of the proposed methodology, highlighting the importance of considering statistical evidence when making decisions.",,,,, ,  2024 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE),Analytical models;Computational modeling;Large language models;Decision making;Data science;Predictive models;Natural language processing;Large Language Model;Transformers;Explain-able Artificial Intelligence;Experiment Design;Statistics

It is key to strengthening social cohesion, the cornerstone of health and success of societies. Thus, empathy could be an important component of effective human-computer interactions through conversations. This has motivated a whole sub-field of research focused on empathetic response generation. The majority of existing methods for empathetic response generation rely on the emotion of the context to generate empathetic responses. However, empathy is much more than generating responses with an appropriate emotion. It also often entails subtle expressions of understanding and personal resonance with the situation of the other interlocutor. Unfortunately, such qualities are difficult to quantify, and the datasets lack relevant annotations. To address this issue, in this paper we propose an approach that relies on exemplars to cue the generative model on fine stylistic properties that signal empathy to the interlocutor. To this end, we employ dense passage retrieval to extract relevant exemplary responses from the training set. Three elements of human communication—emotional presence, interpretation, and exploration—and sentiment are additionally introduced using synthetic labels to guide the generation towards empathy. The human evaluation is also extended by these elements of human communication. We empirically show that these approaches yield significant improvements in empathetic response quality in terms of both automated and human-evaluated metrics.

However, the free EMR texts are lacking consistent standards, rich of private information, and limited in availability. Also, it is often hard to have a balanced number of samples for the types of diseases under study. These problems hinder the development of ML and NLP methods for EMR data analysis. To tackle these problems, we developed a model called Medical Text Generative Adversarial Network or mtGAN, to generate synthetic EMR text. It is based on the GAN framework and is trained by the REINFORCE algorithm. It takes disease tags as inputs and generates synthetic texts as EMRs for the corresponding diseases. We evaluate the model from micro-level, macro-level and application-level on a Chinese EMR text dataset. The results show that the method has a good capacity to fit real data and can generate realistic and diverse EMR samples.

In recent years, there have been huge developments and exciting advances in generation-based text information hiding techniques. Current generative text information hiding methods mainly establish correspondence between token and secret bits based on probability distributions given by language models. However, the semantic control of such methods is weak, and their robustness is not discussed. In this paper, we investigate an end-to-end generation-based text information hiding scheme. The proposed method uses a sequence-to-sequence model with adversarial training as a machine translation model. It converts the secret information into an embedding vector to be added to each position of the hidden state representation of the source language text, which in turn allows the model to automatically learn to produce translation results with the embedded secret information without using fixed rules. The semantics of the text with embedded secret messages obtained by translation can be controlled by the meaning of the source language text. Our experiments show that the proposed method can embed the secret message into the translation results with little loss of the translation quality and is robust to active attacks such as word deletion or synonym substitution.",,,,, ,  2023 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN),Training;Steganography;Semantics;Neural networks;Resists;Transformers;Robustness;robust text information hiding;end-to-end;semantic controllable

In generating the test-cases, a desired property is the ability to control the test-case generation in a flexible manner to test for a large variety of failure cases and to explain and repair them in a targeted manner. In this direction, significant progress has been made in the prior works by manually writing rules for generating controlled counterfactuals. However, this approach requires heavy manual supervision and lacks the flexibility to easily introduce new controls. Motivated by the impressive flexibility of the plug-and-play approach of PPLM, we propose bringing the framework of plug-and-play to counterfactual test case generation task. We introduce CASPer, a plug-and-play counterfactual generation framework to generate test cases that satisfy goal attributes on demand. Our plug-and-play model can steer the test case generation process given any attribute model without requiring attribute-specific training of the model. In experiments, we show that CASPer effectively generates counterfactual text that follow the steering provided by an attribute model while also being fluent, diverse and preserving the original content.

Unlike most prior work which models the spread of Twitter over a network with the goal of predicting the future “state” of a user (typically, as being “hateful” or not), here we are interested in how “hateful” (or toxic) the network as a whole becomes. We pose toxicity spread as a forecasting problem, and use ARIMA to find out whether the spread is forecastable. We find that toxicity spread is indeed forecasted by ARIMA. Given that it is forecastable, we ask two follow-up questions: (a) How well can we forecast it? and (b) What role, if any, does the structure of the retweet network play in forecasting? In order to answer these questions, we employ several techniques including Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolution Network (STGCN) and several variants of transformers. To determine the role that structure might play, we re-purpose the dataset in three ways: the network as a whole (the structure is ignored), communities interconnected with each other, and neighbourhoods of a set of individuals. Experiments with the network as a whole informs us how well we can forecast hate spread at a global level, while the latter experiments tell us whether and how network effects affect the forecasting. In an effort to tease out the effect of the network, we use two distinct techniques: STGCN, which requires the explicit connections in the form of a graph as input; and Transformers, where no explicit graph is given as input. Instead, we pose it as a multivariate analysis problem. We find that the PatchTST transformer performs the best at all levels. STGCN performs better than ARIMA suggesting that network structure matters. Somewhat interestingly, STGCN does not perform as well as PatchTST, suggesting that (a) PatchTST is able to implicitly learn the associations (flow of influence), and (b) the presence of explicit connections may not always imply influence.",,,,, ,  2023 IEEE 5th International Conference on Cognitive Machine Intelligence (CogMI),Toxicology;Social networking (online);Blogs;Time series analysis;Predictive models;Transformers;Forecasting;Forecasting;Hate Speech;Hate Spread;Social Network Analysis;Time Series

(1) PCBs require a very large energy input to cause decomposition and therefore, the methods in use are typically large energy sources. The most widely used method of disposal of pure PCBs, and that preferred by the EPA, is high temperature incineration. However, other methods discussed here include chemical methods and the use of a microwave plasma. (2) In the case of liquids which are contaminated by PCBs, the first two disposal choices involve either destruction, by a combustion method or disposal in a chemical waste landfill.

However, DCE-MRI requires the injection of gadolinium (Gad)based contrast agents during acquisition which is known to have potential toxic effects, posing radiological concerns. Previous deep learning models employed for synthesizing DCE-MRI images consider unimodal structural MRI inputs lacking information about perfusion or perform early to late response predictions requiring Gad-based MRI sequences as input to drive the synthesis. In this work, we consider the heterogeneity in (i) the multimodal MRI structural inputs offering diverse and complementary anatomical features, (ii) the scanner settings and acquisition parameters, and (iii) the importance of incorporating the perfusion information in Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) data, which is essential to learn the hyperintense features for DCE-MRI synthesis.

However, this phenomenon triggers the emergence of the online disinhibition effect, leading individuals to exhibit more aggressive behavior on the internet (toxic disinhibition).

In the context of abusive language detection, comments can be categorized into three classes, i.e., not abusive, abusive but not offensive, and abusive and offensive. Therefore, this study conducts a multiclass classification of Indonesian online news comments with those three categories. Experimental results indicate that SVM with word unigram TF-IDF serves as the best baseline classification model with a macro-average F1-score of 45.37%. We compared Easy Data Augmentation (EDA) and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to address the issue of extreme imbalance in the dataset.

To date, natural esters have been successfully applied in sealed distribution, traction transformers and even a few cases in power transformers. But the fact of being susceptible to oxidation presents it still an engineering challenge of replacing mineral oil by natural esters in those free-breathing transformers. At present, the most commonly used antioxidant in natural esters is BHT, but its non-degradability also brings a big problem. In this paper, different biodegradable antioxidants were added into natural esters and liquid samples filled into specially designed test cells with a volume/surface ratio of 20 mm. The liquid samples in the test cell were aged in an air-circulating oven at 120°C. AC breakdown strength (kV/mm) of the liquid samples was measured periodically during the accelerated ageing experiment. Acid value of the liquid samples was also measured to provide additional information. The results show that the natural ester with biodegradable antioxidants can not only meet the aging property, but also have good breakdown property, which is an ideal substitute for BHT.",,,,, ,  22nd International Symposium on High Voltage Engineering (ISH 2021),

Since inception, manufacturing of mineral oil has gone through several stages of improvement during past 130 years. Further, gas to liquid technology has also been evolved in recent times for mineral oils. Despite the improvement in production technology, Transformer mineral oil suffers from two major disadvantages: lower biodegradability and less fire safety, causing consequential damages during catastrophic failure of Transformers. Further, there are major concerns on the toxic effects of oil spills to nearby environment. Ester based alternate fluids viz. synthetic esters and natural esters mitigate the disadvantages of conventional mineral oil in terms of higher biodegradability and better fire safety. Use of Ester fluids results in less water migration to insulating paper during equilibrium, thereby promoting better insulation dryness and higher equipment life. The experience in India on using alternate environment friendly fluid was till now limited to distribution and medium voltage rating 66 kV class Transformers.

The waste generated from the development of products and processes are of concern to the environmentalist. One of the major issues in recent times is the threat to the human life caused due to the progressive deterioration of the environment. The waste generated from the development of products and processes are of concern to the environmentalist. Heavy metals are also reported persisting into the environment causing toxicity to living organisms through bioaccumulation, adsorption and biotransformation. A number of microorganisms, as a result of their versatility, adaptability and diversity in the environment, are considered to be the best candidates among all living organisms to remediate most of the environmental contaminants into the natural biogeochemical cycle. These natural forces of biodegradation can reduce waste and cleanup some types of environmental contaminants. Compositing can accelerate natural biodegradation and convert organic wastes to valuable resources. Deinococcus radiodurans is known as the world's toughest bacteria and it is the most radiation resistant organism known. Scientists are interested in this organism because of its potential usefulness in cleaning up waste sites that contain radiation and toxic chemicals. It can tolerate radiation levels at 1000 times the levels that would kill a human and it was originally isolated in 1956 from a can of meat that had been irradiated with X-rays. The bacterium can tolerate high levels of chemical, oxidative, UV, and ionizing radiation-induced damage to the cell's DNA, which it efficiently repairs. The resistance to radiation may reflect its resistance to dessication, which also causes DNA damage. This organism may be of use in cleaning up toxic metals found at nuclear weapons production sites due to the radiation resistance. Deinococcus has been genetically engineered for use in bioremediation to consume and digest solvents and heavy metals, even in a highly radioactive site. For example, the bacterial mercuric reductase gene has been cloned from Escherichia coli into Deinococcus to detoxify the ionic mercury residue frequently found in radioactive waste generated from nuclear weapons manufacture. This bacterium is also a highly efficient transformer, and can readily take up exogenous DNA from the environment, which may also aid DNA repair. Bioinformatics offers many interesting possibilities for bioremediation from environment protection point of view. Genomic and bioinformatic data provide a wealth of information that would be greatly enhanced by structural characterisation of some of these proteins in them. It can be extended to follow the leads provided by collaborating bioinformatics experts and proteomics studies. This may ultimately result not only in a more complete understanding of the radiation resistance of this bacterium, but also to the discovery of novel DNA repair systems, applicable to an understanding of the mechanisms of higher organisms such as man. Analysis of paralogs in Deinococcus has revealed several unique protein families. In addition, specific expansions of several other families including phosphatases, proteases, acyltransferases, and Nudix family pyrophosphohydrolases were detected. Genes that potentially affect DNA repair and stress responses and recombination were investigated in this article. These observations suggest that several different biological mechanisms contribute to the multiple DNA repair-dependent phenotypes of this organism. Then D.radiodurans as a bioremediation agent, can remove heavy metals and organic solvents such that the subsequent radionuclide isolation is safer and easier. This analysis is a single substantiation of function of Nudix protein family with is taken from D.radiodurans R1, for the purpose of waste clean up.",,,,, ,  2009 Second International Conference on Environmental and Computer Science,Bioinformatics;Organisms;DNA;Immune system;Microorganisms;Proteins;Humans;Biodegradation;Cleaning;Nuclear weapons;Waste clean up;biodegradation;proteomics;genomics and bioinformatics

However, the high moisture content of vegetable oils is not suitable for a viable dielectric fluid formulation for safe, economic and trouble free operation of power and distribution transformers. The reduction of the moisture level of vegetable oils to an acceptable and safe working level is one of the major steps of development of a highly biodegradable and environment friendly dielectric fluid. This paper describes an analytical method to bench mark the moisture content level of vegetable oil-based dielectric fluids and evaluates several techniques and products for lowering the moisture content level of vegetable oils below the bench marked level for safe operation of power and distribution transformers. The paper also presents the acute toxicity and biodegradation characteristics of the processed vegetable oil-based base fluid to demonstrate its environmental compliance. Experimental results of de-moisturisation using some absorbing materials indicate that the moisture level of vegetable oils can be reduced below the bench marked level to ensure the functional behaviour of vegetable oil-based dielectric fluids.

The task of toxic comment classification focuses on identifying and categorizing harmful or disruptive comments within online discussions.

Reliable use for many years needs to be guaranteed. Besides quality assurance of the manufacturer type testing is the most common way to prove this reliability under normal and extreme conditions. In addition, for dry-type transformers, special tests to prove climatic (C), environmental (E) and fire behaviour (F) class are defined in the international standard IEC 60076-11. End users, e.g. utilities and wind turbine manufacturers, are demanding proof of the claimed qualities of dry-type transformers increasingly. The independent KEMA laboratories, owned by DNV-GL, gained large testing experience for C and E class verification. In 2013 also verification for F class was added to KEMA laboratories portfolio, where now experience has been built-up. For C class verification, a thermal shock test is to be performed. The most common failure is the appearance of cracks, found during visual inspection after the test. The most important part for E2 class verification is the performance of a condensation test, where the transformer is energized while salt condensation is to be present on the surfaces of the object. Failures are flashovers causing voltage breakdowns and serious tracking degrading the transformers dielectric qualities. As part of the F class verification, a complete assembled phase of a transformer is set on fire in a test chamber equipped with air inlet and chimney. Temperatures in the chimney above the allowed limits will lead to unsuccessful results. In the last five years, many (> 40) dry-type distribution transformers (power range up to 3,5 MVA) were tested for verification of one or more of these classes. Often (> 50%) the requirements as per IEC 60076-11 and/or clients specifications could not be met. In some cases design changes and retests were required to meet the requirements, in other cases test programs were stopped due to failure of the object. This paper will explain the importance of the above mentioned tests. Also explanation will be given on the testing methods and procedures required for reliable and reproducible tests, results and conclusions.

Reducing the usage of mineral oil has a lot of advantages and a great deal. In the other hand, Indonesia and Philippines were the two top coconut suppliers in the entire world in 2011-2015. With this capability, Indonesia should utilize conventional coconut oil to become insulation media, especially for power transformer. An alternative insulation media must have similar dielectric characteristics at least as mineral oil. Conventional mineral oil has high dielectric strength, good heat conductivity, a low specific gravity, a low viscosity, a low pour point, a high flash point, safe for the transformer material, and stable. On the other side, coconut oil has dielectric characteristics too. Its characteristic has some similar standard with mineral oil for power transformer. In some researches, half processed of coconut oil has been tested based on the standard. The researchers obtained five parameters. Good result for flashpoint, viscosity at 40°C, and neutralization value of total acidity but not good for breakdown voltage and pour point. It because of the tested coconut oil is commercially available or unrefined coconut oil and researchers needs more test for other parameters. In order to fulfil the standard, Indonesia should process crude coconut oil domestically as insulating media. It will provide a job for seekers, the world's alternative for liquid insulation media, and prosper the coconut gardener. Of course, coconut oil is more environmentally friendly than mineral oil.",,,,, ,  2020 International Conference on Technology and Policy in Energy and Electric Power (ICT-PEP),Oils;Media;Oil insulation;Minerals;Dielectrics;Standards;Power transformer insulation;mineral oil;coconut oil;power transformer;insulation media

In contrast, the legacy of Capsule Neural Networks (CapsNet) appears to have been largely forgotten amidst all of this excitement. This project's objective is to reignite interest in CapsNet by reopening the previously closed studies and conducting a new research into CapsNet's potential. We present a study where CapsNet is used to classify toxic text by leveraging pre-trained BERT embed dings (bert-base-uncased) on a large multilingual dataset. In this experiment, CapsNet was tasked with categorizing toxic text. By comparing the performance of CapsNet to that of other architectures, such as DistilBERT, Vanilla Neural Networks (VNN), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), we were able to achieve an accuracy of 90.44 %. This result highlights the benefits of CapsNet over text data and suggests new ways to enhance their performance so that it is comparable to DistilBERT and other reduced architectures.",,,,, ,  TENCON 2023 - 2023 IEEE Region 10 Conference (TENCON),Neural networks;Text categorization;Natural language processing;Convolutional neural networks;Task analysis;IEEE Regions

One of the reasons behind this trend is the growing popularity of online platforms like Twitter, where people can freely share their thoughts and ideas. However, it is crucial to recognize that social media can occasionally serve as a breeding ground for negative behavior, such as the spread of toxic opinions. Additionally, more information will be collected as more people become active and share their views. Therefore, a technique capable of handling this textual data comprehensively, like classification, is needed. Simple categorization methods could be more effective since they split comments into positive and negative groups. Thus, to overcome such problems, multilevel classification assigns multiple labels to a single instance, allowing its categorization into different categories inside a single statement. This research uses a combination of BERT and BiLSTM methods, whereas BERT is used to obtain word vector values and will then be used as input in the BiLSTM model to perform multi-label classification tasks. This study uses two types of word vectors, the summation of the last four hidden layers and the final hidden layer of BERT, to create a better comparison model.

"Dixon, Fred L., Steward, Dave, Hoffmeister, James",,,When to replace aging transformers,,,10.1109/PCIC.2010.5666818 , ,2010,"Transformers play critical roles in delivering power to distribution equipment for homes, commercial establishments and industrial facilities. Sudden failure of a transformer can have many serious repercussions leading to loss of power for a few minutes to hours. There are instances an outage could last for weeks because of system configuration, such as a simple radial system or the transformer was the single point failure. In industrial complexes an outage lasting a few minutes could lead to loss opportunities as well as millions of dollars in lost production and start up costs. Many older transformers have been in operation for more than 80 years without failure or major problems. Although there have been recent failures of units producing fires and explosions resulting in the release of toxic and combustible gases as well as smoke into the atmosphere; also OSHA has levied fines because of the type of incident. Many transformers in the petrochemical industry now fall under OSHA 1910.119, Mechanical Integrity regulations due to probability of catastrophic failure during power loss, resulting in release of highly hazardous chemicals. Transformers tanks containing more than 10,000 pounds of aggregates in some cases fall underneath the 1910.119 as well as 1910.269 regulations. Mineral oil in transformers is used as a media for cooling and insulating parts within close proximity. Mineral oil has a NFPA flammability rating of 1, indicating it is slightly flammable with a health rating of 1 as well, indicating a slight health hazard. However, during fault conditions mineral oil can be hazardous to your health and the environment. The purpose of this paper is to provide information and insight related to repair or outright replacement of aging transformers containing mineral oil under fault conditions such as the production of combustible gases. This paper will explain how oil sampling, gas analyses, internal inspection and testing were used to determine which required replacing or simple repairs. It will explain the use of standards such as IEEE C57 guidelines, to determine loading, hours of operation, degradation and other tests used to evaluate conditions and suitability for future operation of transformers. It will discuss the use of insulation power factor, Furan and other tests to help predict remaining life in transformers. It will discuss life cycles and vintage of transformer produced in the 1950's versus those manufactured for our facility after 1990. There will be discussions about methods, local repair shops employed to test and evaluate transformer incoming conditions and suitability for future service.",,,,, ,  2010 Record of Conference Papers Industry Applications Society 57th Annual Petroleum and Chemical Industry Conference (PCIC),Oil insulation;Power transformer insulation;Petroleum;Gases;Maintenance engineering

It will result in huge damage of national economy while the transformers break down. On-line monitoring the dissolved gases in oil is one of the effective methods to improve the security and reliability of the power system. CO is the one of main failure characteristic gases in the transformer oil. It's significant to monitor on-line and analyze CO gas for the power transformer's safe operation. The key of on-line monitoring is the gas sensor technology. One-dimensional (1D) semiconductor metal oxide nanostructures have attracted increasing attention in electrochemistry, optics, magnetic, and gas sensing fields for the good properties. N-type low dimensional semiconducting oxides such as SnO2 and ZnO have been known for the detection of inflammable or toxic gases. In this paper, we fabricated the ZnO-SnO2 and SnO2 nanoparticles by hydrothermal synthesis. Microstructure characterization was performed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and surface morphologies for both the pristine and doped samples were observed using field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Then we made thin film gas sensor to study the gas sensing properties of ZnO-SnO2 and SnO2 gas sensor to CO. A systematic comparison study reveals an enhanced gas sensing performance for the sensor made of SnO2 and ZnO towards CO over that of the commonly applied undecorated SnO2 nanoparticles. The improved gas sensing properties are attributed to the size of grains and pronounced electron transfer between the compound nanostructures and the absorbed oxygen species as well as to the heterojunctions of the ZnO nanoparticles to the SnO2 nanoparticles, which provide additional reaction rooms. The results represent an advance of compound nanostructures in further enhancing the functionality of gas sensors, and this facile method could be applicable to many sensing materials, offering a new avenue and direction to detect gases of interest based on composite tin oxide nanoparticles.",,,,, ,  2014 ICHVE International Conference on High Voltage Engineering and Application,Zinc oxide;Materials reliability;Reliability engineering;Monitoring;Ceramics;Heating

"Wang, Zhibing, Yu, Kunshan",,,The research of Power Electronic Transformer (PET) in Smart distribution network,,,10.1109/POWERCON.2010.5666398 , ,2010,"The transformers have been widely used in traditional power system, the primary functions of which are voltage-transformation, isolation and energy-transfer. Now with the development of Smart-Grid, power system requires an increasing penetration of the renewable energy resources and other distributed generations around loads, and an active role for DSOs in controlling the network stability, optimizing central and security. Owing to the bulky iron cores, heavy copper windings and simple functions, the traditional transformer can't satisfy the requirements of SG. Power Electronic Transformer which has been developed for years, can adjust to the development of SG, and improve the performance of distribution system. This paper presents a new topology of PET based on three-level converter, which is used in active medium-voltage distribution network, and supplies a possible solution for bi-directional energy flow of generated loads, and the stability of PS. With the high-performance control strategies-SVM, PET not only realized the all functions of old transformers, but also permitted the distributed power to inject into network. Additionally, the proposed PET performs typical functions and has advantages such as power factor correction, voltage regulation, voltage sag and swell elimination, voltage flicker reduction and protection capability in fault situations. In addition, it has other benefits such as light weight, low volume and no toxic dielectric coolants. First the paper introduced the fundamentals of PET, and studied on the mathematical model of the new topology. In order to verify the validity of this device, we used MATLAB/PST software to simulate the PET model. As a result of divided DC bus with H-bridge converter and connecting of DGs, the neural point's voltage of DC-Bus is unbalanced, the paper proposed an arithmetic to overcome this problem and suppress the effect of ripple voltage on common DC-bus. Eventually simulations results validate the feasibility of the new topology and the control strategies.",,,,, ,  2010 International Conference on Power System Technology,Modulation;Silicon;Neodymium;Nickel;Power System;Power Flow;Smart Grid;Power Electronic Transformer;Solid State Transformer;Intelligent University Transformer;Distribution System Operators;Renewable Energy Source;Distributed Generations;Neutral-Point Clamped;Three Level Converter;Space Vector Modulation

The worldwide depletion of petroleum crudes and alternative to Polychlorinated biphenyls has stimulated the pattern of research and evaluation of hydrocarbons, esters both natural and synthetic in respect of characteristics to suit electrical applications. A number of synthetic dielectric liquids such as silicone oil, organic esters and aromatic hydrocarbons in place of PCB's were developed and are being used in a variety of electrical applications because of their fire-resistance, thermal stability & high dielectric behavior. It is very essential to use such biodegradable, non-toxic dielectric fluids for transformer applications. Not only it is important for a dielectric fluid to be biodegradable, but also it should not pollute the ecosystem by giving out any hazardous materials. When transformers located close proximity to the rivers, canals, sewage treatment work spots, high rise buildings, hospitals and educational institutions, risk is minimized my using fire resistant, biodegradable, non-toxic dielectric fluids.

However, mineral oil is non-biodegradable and non-renewable. It has been predicted that they may run out in the near future. There is thus an urgent need to find their alternatives. Natural, plant based insulating oils are the solution. They are non-toxic, and possess higher fire points and excellent biodegradability characteristics. Therefore, to improve fire safety of transformers and to decrease the harmful environmental impact, there is an increasing demand for these insulating liquids as transformer insulating oils. Persea americana ester (PAE), a plant based oil has high biodegradability and is renewable. PAE has shown through experiments, a likelihood of being an alternative to mineral insulation oil (MIO) because of its good physico-chemical and electrical properties, so far investigated. Since insulating oil for transformers is used over several years, it is imperative to study the ageing characteristics of proposed new insulation oils. Accelerated ageing using open beaker method with copper catalyst was carried out to predict the reliability of Persea americana oil when in operation. The ageing test was based on accelerated thermal ageing to induce the ageing mechanisms within a short period (96 and 164 hours). Results obtained for Specific Resistivity at 27°C and 90°C, Dielectric dissipation factor, Total acidity and sludge for PAE; suggest that PAE could be a potential transformer insulating liquid. For comparison, the corresponding properties of mineral insulation oil (MIO) in the same experimental conditions were also measured. The results obtained as per the IEC and ASTM specifications gives hope for new natural liquid insulation oil.",,,,, ,  2019 IEEE Electrical Insulation Conference (EIC),Vegetable oils;Oxidation;Accelerated aging;Oil insulation;Accelerated ageing;Specific Resistivity;Mineral insulation oil (MIO);Persea americana ester (PAE);ageing characteristics

Therefore, providing the safety of personnel working in underground tunnels by monitoring oxygen, combustible or toxic gases is important. Wearable sensor networks are used in various applications such as oxygen monitoring. Some wearable sensor networks for gas monitoring are powered by batteries. Given the finite lifetime of batteries and the long term stay of underground personnel in these places, e.g. as a result of incidents, having a wearable sensor node with a stable power supply is crucial to conducting oxygen monitoring and notifying the emergency conditions. In order to provide a battery-less operation of the wearable sensor node, one approach is to use ambient energy sources. Considering the fact that the human body can survive only a few minutes without oxygen, the goal of our work is to investigate whether the power generated as a result of temperature difference between the body and ambient air is sufficient to power a sensor node for conducting oxygen detection every 20 seconds. Therefore, we present the development of a wearable sensor node for oxygen detection. The platform consists of a thermoelectric generator (TEG) converter, a sensing circuit for an electrochemical gas sensor and a power management circuit. Our experimental results with our platform indicate that a temperature difference of 6°C between the body and the ambient air and storing the harvested energy in a capacitor ensure the autonomous operation of the wearable sensor node for measurements and alarm actuation conducted every 15 seconds.

The application has been successful in traction and distribution transformers with sealed type. But the susceptibility to oxidation and hence the suspected gelling behaviour prevent the application of natural esters in free-breathing transformers. This paper presents an experimental study of gelling/oxidation behaviour of thin films of a natural ester under thermal ageing. Ageing experiments were carried out with presence of air at different temperatures of 120 °C and 20 °C and durations up to 2 years. The gelling/oxidation behaviour of natural ester was evaluated in terms of changes in viscosity and acidity. Results showed that both viscosity and acidity can be used to assess gelling/oxidation behaviour of natural ester from initial liquid phase to eventually gelled form. In addition to temperature, the thickness of the thin film samples has a significant effect on the gelling speed, i.e. the thinner of the film, the faster of the gelling speed.",,,,, ,  2012 International Conference on High Voltage Engineering and Application,Aging;Viscosity;Films;Oxidation;Temperature measurement;Liquids;Power transformers

These fluids serve as dielectrics and coolants. They are however known to be environmentally toxic and are highly flammable. Hence, they require costly fire protection schemes and deluge systems. Increasing awareness of environmental protection and fire safety is leading to accelerating trend of looking for plant based oil alternatives that are environmentally friendly. Increase in power rating of electrical equipment also calls for high temperature performance insulating oils. Plant based dielectric fluids have been found to defeat mineral oils in many of these aspects. They are nontoxic, possess better thermal properties and have excellent biodegradability. In order to reduce the adverse environmental impact and to improve the fire safety of transformers, there is an increasing demand for plant based insulating liquids as transformer insulating oils.

For comparison, the corresponding properties of mineral insulation oil (MIO) in the same experimental conditions were also measured and compared with those of PAE. In this investigation, two different types of Persea americana oil samples consisting of extra virgin and refined PAE were tested.

This paper discusses the wind energy system connected to the micro grid system used for small scale operations. Wind Energy Systems are connected to the grid through a conventional two level inverter which results in high value of THD and harmonics in current. This problem can be overcome by multilevel converter with different switching strategies.

Mineral oil is obtained from petroleum through distillation processes. Petroleum is known as non-renewable resources and non-biodegradable. The flash point of mineral oil is around 150°C, thus it creates a problem for high temperature condition. Based on those facts, a new formula of liquid insulation is needed to replace mineral oil. Natural ester oil is derived from vegetable oil. It is biodegradable, non-toxic, non-flammable, and has a higher breakdown voltage. However, the viscosity of vegetable oil is high so that further treatment is needed in order to reduce the viscosity of the oil. This paper reports a sequential procedure in making natural ester oil through transesterification processes using palm oil for transformer application. The alkyl ester can be obtained from the reaction of triglycerides, alcohol and strong base as a catalyst. The by-product, which is glycerol, is then separated from the oil by using gravitational method as its density is higher than the natural ester oil. In this research, methanol is used as a reactant in transesterification reaction due to its cheap price and its fast reactivity. Potassium hydroxide also has a big role in transesterification, its used as a catalyst to make the process easier.",,,,, ,  2019 2nd International Conference on High Voltage Engineering and Power Systems (ICHVEPS),Vegetable oils;Carbon;Methanol;Production;Silicon compounds;Biofuels;transesterification;natural ester;palm oil;transformer

Our sensor is able to determine water traces in D2O and aprotic organic solvents. Treating the material to solvent leads to the change in intensities ratio of terbium and europium bands in emission spectra depending of water content and nature of solvent. For D2O calibrating plot $\text{I}_{\mathrm {Eu}}/\text{I}_{\mathrm {Tb}}$ –%H2O is linear whereas for dioxane and acetonitrile the dependence becomes linear in the coordinates $\text{I}_{\mathrm {Eu}}/\text{I}_{\mathrm {Tb}}$ -ln(%H2O). The results reveal the potential application of developed sensor for ratiometric quantitation of H2O admixtures in D2O, organic solvents, transformer oil, etc.",,,,, ,  ,Sensors;Compounds;Water;Solvents;Luminescence;Europium;Chemical and biological sensors;optical sensors;luminescent devices

This has contributed to climate change owing to the emission of toxic gases, where humans are growing ail because of the contaminated atmosphere. Renewable Energy Systems (RESs) are progressively regarded as power consumers' backbone. This is because the energy generated from RESs does not pose a risk to the ecosystem. Another driving force is that the larger the power system, the higher the power demand and the higher the cost. As a result, there will be an acute shortage of coal for power generation in the coming years. Therefore, the grid will be compromised due to an inability to match load requirements, possibly leading to load shedding. RESs are used as a supplement to an existing power grid or as an islanded mode configuration for a load proportional to the output voltage of the microgrid (MG). Innovative solutions must ensure that the load connected is continuously energised under normal conditions.

The monitoring of toxic or inflammable gases has been increasingly important for humans, environment and various areas. In the power system field, power transformers are important equipment of electricity transmission and distribution, and its operation condition is associated with the safety of power system. If the power transformers break down, there will be a huge lose in national economic. Hydrogen (H2) is one of the main fault characteristic gases dissolved in transformer oil, which can indicate the high energy discharge, spark discharge, partial discharge and partial oil overheating. The gas sensor technology is the key of on-line monitoring trace amount of gases. This paper made a research on the detection characteristics of CuO-SnO2 gas sensor to the H2 gas dissolved in transformer oil. In this study, a facile hydrothermal method was adopted to fabricate SnO2 and CuO-SnO2 nanoparticles. The CuO content was chosen as 5mol-% (sample 1), 10mol-% (sample 2) and 15mol-% (sample 3). Microstructures and surface morphologies for all samples were characterised by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Then the gas sensing mechanism of gas sensor was analyzed. The results proved that: A lot of p-n heterojunction would form which change the gas sensing properties of composite SnO2-based gas sensor to hydrogen; compared with the SnO2 gas sensor, the CuO-SnO2 performed better sensitivity and quicker response to the H2,and also kept a good linearity and stability.

When a partial discharge or local overheating occurs inside the GIS, SF6will decompose and produce various by-products (including SO2, SO2F2, COS, H2S, SOF2 and etc) that are toxic and corrosive. The reduction of SF6 gas concentration and the generation of corrosive gases will lead to a decrease in the internal insulation strength of GIS. By monitoring the concentration of SF6in GIS, it can help us to judge the operating status of GIS and prevent fault. In this paper, we build a gas Raman spectroscopy gas detection platform. The light source of the detection platform is a solid-state laser with a wavelength of 532nm and a laser power of 1.5W. A self-designed gas cell is used to contain the gas to be measured. A spectrometer and CCD are used to collect Raman signals. Based on this Raman spectroscopy gas detection platform, a Raman spectroscopy study of SF6was carried out. Under 1 atmosphere pressure, Based on the built Raman detection platform, Raman spectroscopy of SF6with a concentration of 99.99% was obtained.

Several secondary particles are produced during the treatments mainly photons, protons and neutrons. The reduced attenuation length of neutrons yields a secondary particle sample that is larger in number when compared to photons and charged particles. Since neutrons can release a significant dose far away from the tumour region, a precise measurement of their flux, production energy and angle distributions is eagerly needed in order to improve the Treatment Planning Systems (TPS) software, so to properly take into account not only the normal tissue toxicity in the target region, but also the risk of late complications in the whole body. The MONDO (MOnitor for Neutron Dose in hadrOntherapy) project addresses the technical challenges posed by a neutron detector aiming for high detection efficiency and good backtracking precision. The main goal of the project is to develop a tracking detector targeting fast and ultra-fast secondary neutrons based on the reconstruction of two consequent elastic scattering interactions of a neutron with a target material. By reconstructing the recoiling protons, it is hence possible to measure the energy and incoming direction of the neutron using different therapeutic beams (protons, 12C ions and possibly 4He and 16O ions).

Radiation hardness, soft tissue equivalence, lack of toxicity, negligible energy dependence and optimal sensitivity and reproducibility, have made PTW the ideal metering device for clinical dosimetry. However general use of natural dosimeters have been hindered by their rarity, very high cost and unpredictable electronic behavior due to lack of control on impurity content and crystal defects. Therefore, there have been a growing use of silicon dosimeters especially for on line configuration and in vivo dosimetry. However, both MOSFET and silicon diode do not appear to be ideal for such application for their short lifetime.

However, the instability and the potential toxicity of conventional lead-based MHPs constitute a challenge for commercialization, which prompts the use of alternative perovskite inspired materials based on less toxic elements, such as bismuth and silver to replace lead. Furthermore, to enable large-area, highperformance, detectors, it is paramount to employ methods to produce high-quality, millimetre-thick, layers of the detector material, which currently remains a challenge for MHPs. In this work, different lead-free, perovskite-inspired, materials, which include fully inorganic compounds, such as the double perovskite Cs2 AgBiBr6, as well as novel organic-inorganic ones were investigated as X-ray detectors. The materials were synthesized using ball-milling and polycrystalline pellets produced through scalable cold isostatic-pressing were used to assemble X-ray detectors. X-ray-based spectroscopic and diffraction methods were used to determine the composition and structural properties of the pellets. The detector performance was evaluated by measuring the photocurrent response under X-ray illumination. The results show that the selection of composition, additives, different post-treatment methods of the pellets as well as device architecture significantly affect the properties, potentially improving detector performance for various applications.

However, if used for positron emission tomography (PET), semiconductor-based detectors normally cannot achieve excellent coincidence time resolution (CTR), due to the relatively slow charge carrier collection time limited by the carrier drift velocity. If we can collect prompt photons emitted from certain semiconductor materials, there are possibilities that the CTR can be greatly improved, and time-of-flight (ToF) capability can be achieved. In this article, we studied the prompt photon emission (mainly, the Cherenkov luminescence) property and fast timing capability of cesium lead chloride (CsPbCl3) and cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr3), which are two new perovskite semiconductor materials. We also compared their performance with thallium bromide (TlBr), another semiconductor material that has already been studied for timing using its Cherenkov emissions. We performed coincidence measurements using silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs), and the full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) CTR acquired between a semiconductor sample crystal and a reference lutetium-yttrium oxyorthosilicate (LYSO) crystal (both with dimensions of $3\times 3\times 3\,\mathrm {mm^{3}}$ ) is ${\mathbf {248\pm 8~ps}}$ for CsPbCl3, ${\mathbf {440\pm 31~ps}}$ for CsPbBr3, and ${\mathbf {343\pm 16~ps}}$ for TlBr. Deconvolving the contribution to CTR from the reference LYSO crystal (around 100 ps) and then multiplying by the square root of 2, the estimated CTR between two of the same semiconductor crystals was calculated as ${\mathbf {324\pm 10~ps}}$ for CsPbCl3, ${\mathbf {606\pm 43~ps}}$ for CsPbBr3, and ${\mathbf {464\pm 22~ps}}$ for TlBr.

We compare the performance of three detector crystals for this method including two types of cadmium telluride (CdTe) crystals and one bismuth silicon oxide (BSO) crystal under high bias voltages up to 3500V. We first show that the induced current flow in the detector crystal determines the strength of the optical property modulation signal due to ionization. A larger resistivity is favorable for reducing the dark current (noise) in the crystal and facilitates the detection of weak optical property modulation signals. In addition, we show that BSO is a potential candidate detector material. When biased at 3500 V, it has comparable modulation signal sensitivity as CdTe biased at 1000V, but with higher resistivity (lower noise), larger 511 keV photon attenuation coefficient, lower price, better crystal surface finish quality, and less toxicity. By studying the dependence of modulation signal amplitude on crystal bias voltage, we show that the modulation signal amplitude (induced by both UV laser diode and Ge-68 source) is linearly proportional to crystal bias voltage with a linear fit R factor of around 0.95. The modulation signal amplitude induced by UV laser diode irradiation increases from 0% to 2% (normalized to the average signal level) for both CdTe and BSO under crystal bias voltage from 0V to 3500V. The modulation signal amplitude induced by Ge-68 irradiation increases from 0% to 12% for CdTe under crystal bias voltage from 0V to 1500 V, and increases from 0% to 10% for BSO under crystal bias voltage from 0V to 3500 V. Therefore the electron multiplication effect (with high crystal bias) shows promise to significantly boost the modulation signal amplitude with the ultimate goal to achieve single 511 keV photon detection.",,,,, ,"  2016 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium, Medical Imaging Conference and Room-Temperature Semiconductor Detector Workshop (NSS/MIC/RTSD)",Crystals;Optical modulation;Optical sensors;Conductivity;Detectors;Photonics;ToF-PET;optical property modulation;cadmium telluride;bismuth silicon oxide;electron multiplication effect

Real-time beam monitoring and dosimetry for FLASH are challenging and new approaches have been proposed to address this issue. Along this line, novel detectors based on fiber-coupled scintillators are under development at the University of Bern.

One solution to remedy this is the usage of effective microorganism (EM). EM is a low-cost, non-harmful, non-pathogenic, non-genetically modified solution commonly used for waste treatment. In this study, the researchers developed a system that automatically detects toxicity levels of gases and reduces it, together with the foul odor, using automatic spraying of activated EM solution.

However, the limited availability of data and technologies that quantify dose distribution on spatial scales relevant to the alpha particle range impairs accurate characterization of novel αRPT agents. Here, we demonstrate that 2D digital autoradiography with an ionizing-radiation quantum imaging detector (iQID) can facilitate 3D volumetric dosimetry of targeted and non-targeted tissues. A series of 10-μm cryosections extracted every 200 μm spanning the organ or tumor is measured with the device. These activity maps are used in a previously developed Monte Carlo dose kernel convolution procedure to obtain dose-rate images, which we digitally register into a 3D volume via intensity-maximization rigid-body transformations. The resulting dose-rate organ or tumor volume has an effective voxel size of 39 x 39 x 210 μm. To permit the measurement of only one slice at each position, we validate a digital duplication approximation with a secondary experiment measuring 10 consecutive 10-μmslices in each tissue. We use this technique to sample dose-rate measurements across whole tumors and kidneys from a murine study of 225Ac-MACROPA-YS5, a novel αRPT agent with specificity to CD46-positive tumors. Renal cortical dose rate is over twice that of the medullary region, which suggests that free progeny 213Bi, which is known to collect in the renal cortex, is the source of nephrotoxicity in 225Ac αRPT.",,,,, ,"  2023 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium, Medical Imaging Conference and International Symposium on Room-Temperature Semiconductor Detectors (NSS MIC RTSD)",Semiconductor device measurement;Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays;Toxicology;Semiconductor detectors;Alpha particles;Position measurement

However, the application of alpha-emitters in Targeted Alpha Therapies (TATs) may lead to the release of daughter products, which can migrate away from the tumor site and cause toxicity in nearby tissues and organs. To identify the biodistribution of primary α-emitters and their daughters, SPECT scanner with superior energy resolution is crucial to differentiate specific gamma-rays from different isotopes and distinguish the primary signal from scattering noise events. Because TAT imaging typically utilizes very low concentrations of alpha-particle emitters less than 1 μCi, the image reconstruction with denoising is necessary. Recently, we have developed an innovative preclinical SPECT system at UIUC featuring smallpixel CdTe detectors, which provides ultra-high energy resolution and exceptional spatial resolution for small-animal αRPT imaging applications. In this study, we focused on low count SPECT reconstruction, which involves 1) constructing a system matrix using voxel-driven forward/backward projectors, and 2) implementing a penalized SPECT reconstruction method utilizing the forward-backward splitting approach. We evaluated our approach using a resolution phantom filled with diagnostic isotope Tc-99m (1.5 mCi).

Chamber efficiencies greater than 30% are required for neutron coincidence and multiplicity counting systems. Existing systems are based on 3He proportional counters and require hundreds of liters of this gas. The severe 3He shortage has created a driver to evaluate alternative detectors in this application. An alternate design must meet the following performance requirements: 1) high absolute detection efficiency, 2) low gamma ray sensitivity and 3) short die-away times. In addition, practical aspects of the detectors must be considered including: 1) system lifetime costs, 2) backward compatibility with existing protocols, 3) long term stability in industrial environments, 4) low maintenance, 5) technology maturity, 6) production scalability and 7) materials toxicity.

This paper discusses the feasibility of using proton beams to transmute the LLFPs into shorter-lived or stable isotopes. Although long-term storage for high-level waste would still be required, transmuting the LLFPs can reduce the volume of waste material stored. PHITS, a Monte Carlo transport code, is utilized to computationally model the interactions between the LLFP materials and the proton beam. PHITS is used in this paper to estimate the flux-energy spectrum and number of atoms irradiated in the LLFP target when interacting with the beam. This data is then post-processed in a 0-dimensional analysis in FISPACT to estimate the transmutation rate for each LLFP. Analysis of the performance of commercial cyclotrons with energies of 18-70 MeV has shown that transmutation rates will increase when the proton beam energy is increased. A cyclotron with a beam current of 10 mA and beam energy of 70 MeV running continuously can transmute 7.51 ± 1.19 g/year of technetium-99. However, technetium-99 is produced at around a rate of 1kg/year inside a 1 GW reactor, suggesting that commercial cyclotrons are not viable for transmutation purposes. Studies are ongoing on modeling 1000 MeV proton beams to cause spallation reactions inside the LLFP targets. The spallation process burns the LLFP target while producing many secondary neutrons that can be further used for transmuting the LLFPs. A preliminary analysis suggests that a 1000 MeV beam with a 10 mA current can transmute around 1kg/year of technetium-99 due to nuclear reactions without accounting for spallation reactions.",,,,, ,"  2024 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium (NSS), Medical Imaging Conference (MIC) and Room Temperature Semiconductor Detector Conference (RTSD)",Particle beams;Waste materials;Microwave integrated circuits;Monte Carlo methods;Semiconductor detectors;Neutrons;Recycling

Deploying IoT enabled smoke sensors not only help to sense, collect, and transmit the smoke data to the control station, but also enable a dynamic and real-time evacuation approach to increase the evacuation success probability. In this paper, two smoke-aware evacuation approaches are proposed. The individual evacuation mathematical model and the associated SIEP algorithm are first devised to identify a fastest smoke toxic safe evacuation path for an evacuee. Next, the group evacuation mathematical model and the associated SGEP algorithm are devised to evacuate as many evacuees as possible in considering the smoke toxicity and flow congestion along the evacuation routes. SGEP circumvents the congestion problem by scheduling the evacuation sequence according to evacuee’s accumulated smoke toxicity value, where higher accumulated smoke toxicity value has higher evacuation priority to prevent incapacitation at evacuation. The FDS simulations based on the real layout of Taipei 101 mall are performed to compare the evacuation success probability between SIEP and SGEP at methane fire and PVC fire. The simulation results show that smoke from PVC fire is more toxic than that of methane fire. In addition, enabling sprinklers can reduce the percentage of toxic nodes up to 41% at methane fire and up to 10% at PCV fire, as compared to not enabling them. These results indicate that it is more challenging to evacuate at PVC fire than at methane fire. The simulation results in SGEP and SIEP justify the above conclusions where the success evacuation probability differences between methane fire and PVC fire are up to 39% (i.e., 100% and 61%) and 52.5% (i.e., 82.5% and 30%) for SGEP and SIEP, respectively. The simulation results also show that SGEP outperforms SIEP in terms of evacuation success probability at all simulation settings, especially when large number of evacuees are to be evacuated. At methane fire, the largest evacuation success probability difference between SGEP and SIEP is 68.1% at 1000 evacuees, 0.3 FED threshold and without sprinklers. At PVC fire, the largest difference is 50% at 1000 evacuees, 0.5 FED threshold and with sprinklers. These significant differences in evacuation success probability come from the evacuation congestion in SIEP. The evacuation scheduling approach based on accumulated smoke toxicity policy enables SGEP to circumvent the evacuation congestion, and to get better evacuation success probability. Besides identifying safe evacuation route and evacuation scheduling policy during congestion to evacuate more evacuees, another contribution of this paper is to identify the critical percentage of toxic nodes for safe fire evacuation and rescue operations.",,,,, ,  ,Fires;Temperature sensors;Heating systems;Gases;Toxicology;Escalators;Methane;Mathematical models;Heuristic algorithms;Real-time systems;Hazardous areas;Emergency services;Smoke detectors;Safety;Individual evacuation;group evacuation;evacuation congestion;smoke sensors;fire evacuation planning and optimization

Moreover, acetone serves as a vital biomarker for diabetes. Consequently, the demand for low-concentration acetone gas detection sensors is increasingly pressing in numerous sectors, including industrial processes and medical applications. In this study, we report a novel sensor based on Co3O4/ZnO nanorods and investigate the influence of Co doping-induced oxygen vacancies and the presence of Co3O4 on the sensing properties. The sensor was prepared through a simple one-step hydrothermal method and named Co/ZnONRs. The morphology, composition, and oxygen vacancy defects of the Co/ZnONRs were characterized using various techniques including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). Characterization and gas sensing test results have demonstrated that the 1-Co/ZnONRs sensor outperformed previously reported designs, exhibiting high response values, short response times, good selectivity, and low detection limits toward acetone. Specifically, at 250 °C, the sensor demonstrated a response value of 833.33 toward 100-ppm acetone, which is an increase of ten times compared to the response value of ZnONRs, while the optimal operating temperature decreased by 50 °C, and the detection limit was as low as 100 ppb. The improved sensor performance is attributed to several factors such as changes in resistance caused by active sites generated by Co doping ZnO to form oxygen vacancies, the Co3O4/ZnO heterojunction, the high specific surface area of Co/ZnONRs, and the unique catalytic activity of Co3O4. These findings demonstrate the potential of our innovative design to significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of gas sensors used in industrial processes and medical diagnoses.",,,,, ,  ,Sensors;Zinc oxide;II-VI semiconductor materials;Gas detectors;Temperature sensors;Metals;Heterojunctions;Acetone gas sensors;high response value;oxygen vacancies;p-n heterostructure;rapid response

And how to distinguish them from the huge number of normal web pages effectively remains a huge challenge in the era of big data. To detect malicious pages, one needs to first collect candidate web pages that are live on the web; then filter massive legitimate pages using fast filters and finally examine the remaining pages using precisely but slow analyzer. However, there are new challenges recently for these conventional techniques, including large scale, imbalance data and the usage of cloaking techniques. To cope with these challenges, the malicious URL detection system should perform more efficiently. In this paper, we propose a system, named GuidedTracker, to search for suspicious malicious pages. GuidedTracker starts from the seed set which includes known malicious pages. Then, it automatically figures out those victims based on the seed set and the visit relation database. Finally, the access records of these victims are used to identify other malicious pages. In this way, GuidedTracker increase the percentages of malicious URLs in the input URL stream submitted to the precisely analyzer. To our best knowledge, GuidedTracker is the first to introduce visit relations to tackle the malicious URL detection problem. The introduction of visit relations limits the scope of URL inspection and enables this approach to have the ability of self-learning. Experimental results show that the overall ""toxicity"" can be improved by 6.97%-50.38% compared with full inspection of access logs.",,,,, ,  2014 IEEE Global Communications Conference,Web pages;Uniform resource locators;Inspection;Security;Detectors;Information systems

This oftentimes leads to insufficient damage to cancer cells and excessive damage to the surrounding healthy tissues, both increasing toxicity and the risk of cancer recurrence later in life for many patients. An understanding of X-ray energy deposition at the single-X-ray level is, therefore, necessary to improve the efficacy of cancer radiotherapy. Here, we present a single-X-ray sensitive, energy-binning integrated circuit (IC)-based dosimeter, fabricated in 180 nm CMOS technology, to enable closed-loop cancer radiotherapy for personalized patient treatment. We use small 3 $\times$ 3 $\mu$m reverse-biased deep n-well (DNWELL) diodes designed at low capacitive nodes (C$_{\mathrm{diode}}$), such that the miniscule charge deposition (Q$_{\mathrm{dep}}$) from single X-rays at these nodes generates a voltage signal large enough to be sensed (V$_{\mathrm{diode}}$ = Q$_{\mathrm{dep}}$/C$_{\mathrm{diode}}$). In order to enable single-X-ray energy resolution without significant power and area, we implement an analog voltage supply (AVDDH) $\sim$log resistor grid to create a sensitivity gradient across the 76 $\times$ 55 pixel array. The IC-based dosimeter was tested under scenarios consistent with the treatment of shallow lesions (e.g., skin cancer, superficial tumors, intraoperative radiotherapy). The system is highly linear with radiation dose (10–250 cGy) and accurately tracks dose up to 2 cm deep in tissue for 50-, 70-, and 100-kV X-ray beams.",,,,, ,  ,Cancer;Radiation therapy;Photonics;Energy resolution;Electrons;Uncertainty;Scattering;Energy measurement;Detectors;Biological tissues;X-ray;dosimeter;cancer;radiotherapy;closed-loop

In certain cases the sediments may also serve as contaminant sources, releasing contaminants later when water column and/or pore water conditions change. Variations in sediment chemical and physical properties make it impossible to rely on bulk sediment contaminant concentrations alone to predict contaminant flux, bioavailability, and therefore toxicity. In situ measurements of contaminant fluxes across the sediment-water interface provide important information for addressing these concerns. The Navy has recently developed the Benthic Flux Sampling Device (BFSD) to assess contaminant fluxes across the sediment-water interface. The BFSD has recently undergone several modifications to allow improved operation. The oxygen regulation system has been modified to allow better control of chamber oxygen levels. Some deployments have utilized real-time sensors that allow monitoring of BFSD operations and offer the potential to serve as field-screening tools to evaluate contaminant mobility. These real-time sensor techniques include potentiometric stripping analysis (PSA) for metals and laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) for hydrocarbon contaminants. As part of the Navy's ongoing program to monitor environmental conditions in San Diego Bay, this study used multiple deployments of the BFSD to assess contaminant fluxes across the sediment-water interface. In coastal areas, directly measured BFSD fluxes are often preferable to model-dependent fluxes obtained from pore water profiles. Target contaminants in this study included the trace metals Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn. Initial results indicate fluxes occur both into and out of the sediments depending on contaminant type and site location. The metals that showed the most consistent flux out of the sediments included Zn and Mn.",,,,, ,  'Challenges of Our Changing Global Environment'. Conference Proceedings.

Carbon monoxide is one most dangerous gas and nowadays there were many fatal cases happen caused by the gas leakage, while increasing of the concentration carbon dioxide will reduce oxygen level in the air, thus can cause the driver to be fatigue, and sleepiness. Moreover, gas detector usually not installed in nowadays car. To develop smart air quality monitoring system, Arduino MKR 1010, CJMCU 811(carbon dioxide sensor), MQ-7(carbon monoxide sensor), Adafruit io application, IFTTT, Webhooks, Telegram, and MATLAB fuzzy logic toolbox were used. Furthermore, Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) was used to analyze the input and produce the system's output decisions on the level of gas toxicities. The five levels of gas toxicities are very safe, safe, warning, high, and very high. The decision of gas level will be sent to IOT application which is Adafruit and then triggered the three types of LED indicator, power window motor, buzzer, and signal to webhook to send the Telegram. Besides, Adafruit IO also act as the platform to present the data of gases graph pattern.

To accomplish this, two parameters are used. The first parameter relates to the GC retention time (RT), which is the residence time of an analyte as it passes through the column. Different chemicals have different RTs. The second parameter is the drift time of ionized species derived for a specific chemical in the IMS. Due to molecular cross section, mass, and chemical properties, different chemicals produce ionized species with different drift times. Combining these two parameters, GC-IMS has been shown to distinguish between different chemicals. Chemical detection and identification are not that easy in practice. First, the concentration of chemicals may be very low, and it may be difficult to determine the chromatographic RT and IMS drift time for chemicals under these conditions. Second, the specific ionized species produced in the IMS are concentration dependent and the IMS spectra obtained at different analyte concentrations are not easily predictable. For example, at low concentrations, chemicals seldom form dimers following atmospheric pressure ionization. The possible presence of either monomers or dimers in the IMS drift tube may confuse the chemical classification process. Third, it is important to estimate the concentration of chemicals, as this information will provide toxicity, and the linear dynamic range of typical IMS systems is relatively low In this study, an image processing approach to enhancing the GC-IMS signal quality is introduced. The key idea in this approach is to treat GC-IMS data as an image and then apply an anomaly detector to detect and enhance abnormal regions in the image. The results of a study that compares a conventional approach to chemical detection and the introduced image enhancement approach are presented.

From intricate microchip fabrication in the semiconductor industry to strengthening tooth enamel in dentistry, its unique properties find diverse applications. However, storing high-pressure fluorine tanks poses significant safety risks. Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) offers a promising alternative by generating fluorine on-demand, eliminating storage needs and minimizing human contact, while simultaneously presenting its own advantages for various fields. This shift towards safer, controlled generation methods like CAP paves the way for further unlocking fluorine’s immense potential across various sectors. A 2 MHz, six-electrode cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) device was designed and fabricated to generate fluorine from an Ar + CF4 gas mixture. Visual observation revealed a two-toned plasma flame, suggesting spatial variation in species distribution. Fluorine emission was confirmed using a Portasens III detector, while further analysis by optical emission spectroscopy (OES) revealed the presence of strong Fe I emission lines alongside other species of atmosphere and Ar I emission lines.

Liver's health is assessed by a group of clinical tests (such as blood tests, ultrasonographic imaging, liver biopsy) most of which are invasive and burdensome for the patients. In the setting of severely scarred liver, toxic substances, such as ammonia, have fewer opportunities to be detoxified. Accumulation of ammonia in the systemic circulation and in the brain may result in Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE), a spectrum of neuropsychiatric abnormalities which entails changes in consciousness, intellectual functions, behavior. Minimal HE has attracted increasing attention, as it does not cause detectable changes in personality or behaviour, but the complex and sustained attention is impaired. Hence, it can be detected only by specific but biased, time-consuming and burdensome examinations, such as blood ammonia levels assessment and neuro-psychological tests. The obstrusivity of the majority of the liver function clinical tests, and, in case of minimal HE, the lack of reliable examinations, are encouraging the scientific community to look for alternative diagnostic methods. For this purpose, the exploitation of a non-invasive technique such as breath analysis, to identify chronic liver disease, discriminate among its degree of severity and detect the onset of HE, could be a step forward for clinical diagnosis.

Sensors incorporating well-packaged wavelength-stabilized near-IR (1.2-2.0 ¿m) laser sources sense over a dozen toxic or industrially-important gases. Recently developed mid-IR lasers, particularly quantum cascade devices spanning wavelengths of 3-12 ¿m, can sense in real-time sub-parts per million concentrations of many hydrocarbons.A large emerging application for TDLAS is standoff sensing of chemical vapors, e.g., leaks from natural gas pipelines. Employing a 10-mW DFB laser, the eye-safe, battery-powered, 6-lb handheld remote methane leak detector illuminates a noncooperative topographic surface and analyzes returned scattered light to deduce the presence of excess methane. For aerial surveying, replacing the handheld transceiver with a large-aperture telescope and adding an erbium-doped fiber amplifier to the laser transmitter extends the standoff distance to 3000 m. By selecting a laser source having an appropriate wavelength, the standoff TDLAS tool detects trace concentrations of nonmethane hazardous gases, including several high-priority toxic industrial compounds and emissions from illicit chemical production laboratories. This paper also describes concepts for miniature integrated optic TDLAS sensors that combine a laser source, sampling section, and detector on a monolithic semiconductor materials system substrate.

We demonstrate TXs and RXs with integrated antennas for spectroscopy at 238-252 GHz and 494-500 GHz using integer-N phase-locked loops (PLLs). We present a compact system by using fractional-N PLLs allowing frequency ramps for the TX and RX, and for TX with superimposed frequency shift keying or reference frequency modulation. In another configuration, the voltage controlled oscillators of the TX and RX local oscillator are tuned directly without PLLs by applying external voltages. Further developments of our system are aimed at realizing an even wider frequency span by switching between frequency bands, and to use a more compact gas absorption cell.",,,,, ,  ,Spectroscopy;Absorption;Frequency shift keying;Phase locked loops;Detectors;Silicon germanium;Gas spectroscopy;mm-wave (mmW);receiver;sensor;SiGe;terahertz (THz);transmitter

Such issues led to growing research on text detoxification systems that can automatically rewrite toxic content. A systematic evaluation is required to ensure these systems produce high-quality detoxified text that modifies the original text to be non-toxic while preserving its content. However, this often relies on large amounts of labelled data and human judgement, which may not always be feasible. This limitation is typically known as the oracle problem. Metamorphic testing (MT) has conventionally been used to solve the oracle problem by deriving metamorphic relations (MRs) to test a program’s functionality. A new MT approach focused on data validation showed that MRs incorporated with tools can be used to identify defects in machine translation services. This paper draws inspiration from this new MT perspective by presenting four metamorphic relations incorporated with tools to evaluate style transfer accuracy, content preservation, fluency, and a joint of these three.

In this study, how a diet containing turmeric and its extract affected the liver, kidney, heart, and serum of rats treated with alloxan was examined. The impacts were evaluated by measuring the levels of alkaline phosphatase and alanine aminotransferase in those organs mentioned earlier. Forty female albino rats were divided randomly into five groups (A, B, C, D, and E) each containing five rats. Groups A, C, and E received a diet containing 5% turmeric formulation. Group B was fed a basal diet, while groups D and E received daily oral administration of 10% turmeric crude extract. The dietary study continued for 21 days, following which all groups aside from group A received an induction of 150 mg/kg body weight of alloxan and were then monitored for 48 hours. The Blood glucose levels of each rat were determined using a glucometer. Administration of alloxan led to detrimental effects on the functions of certain organs, including the liver, heart, and plasma. This is supported by a notable elevation (P ≤ 0.05) in the levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) enzymes in the group of rats induced with alloxan, in comparison to the normal control group. Pre-administration of a turmeric-formulated diet and extract to rats treated with alloxan mitigated the impact of alloxan on the activities of ALP and AST enzymes in the liver compared to rats treated with alloxan alone. This was demonstrated by the significant reduction in the activities of liver ALP and AST of rats in group B when compared with the control group (A). Also, there was a remarkable significant difference (p ≤ 0.05) in the activities of ALP and AST enzymes in group (E) compared with the negative control.

While traditional approaches are useful for developing these tools, they have various shortcomings where LLMs can potentially mitigates these issues. LLMs accept prompts as inputs to condition generated outputs.

DDIs arise when significant alterations occur in the pharmacological action of a drug due to its co-administration with another drug, leading to potential adverse drug reactions (ADRs), toxicity or diminished therapeutic efficacy. Apart from the obvious cases of drug combinations that should be avoided, there are instances where risk-benefit analysis may allow co-administration. Hence, DDIs may represent clinically significant cases depending on the clinical outcome, time point of administration, etc. The issue is especially critical in cases of patients with multimorbidity and complex therapeutic regimens with different time points in drug administrations. This work employs a graph-based approach aimed at optimizing therapeutic regiments while considering the minimization of DDIs potential. In this approach each drug is represented as a node, and edges represent the clinical significance of DDIs. We aim to identify sets of drugs that either have no DDIs or exhibit minor to moderate clinical significance (referred to as Maximal Independent Sets), indicating that they can be taken together. In practice, we solved the complementary problem, which is finding Maximal Cliques. Both problems are NP-hard, but for small graphs, they can be solved exactly. From all the cliques we identify, those selected to be a part of each proposed therapeutic regimen must consist of nodes that appear only once. This problem is once again reduced to clique finding. The above approach is demonstrated using two clinical scenarios involving two patients who are experiencing polypharmacy and are at risk for ADRs due to potential DDIs of varying clinical significance.

However, these methods often show bias by overreacting to words such as identity terms, profanity, and swear words that occur in non-toxic speech and erroneously classifying them as toxic speech. Recent research has attempted to regularise relevant biased words in predefined lexicons to mitigate their impact on model classification. However, this approach faces two challenges. Firstly, words such as pro-fanity and swear words in biased words play a crucial role in the model's ability to identify toxic speech, and excessive suppression of these words using regularization methods can detrimentally affect the performance of the classification model. Secondly, due to the limitations of regularization techniques, existing methods rely on manually constructed biased word dictionaries, which can only mitigate bias associated with identity-related terms. This bias should not significantly impact hate speech prediction. It is challenging to encompass lexical biases such as profanity and swear words that are specific to different datasets beyond identity terms To address the above challenges, this paper proposes a novel feature attribution-guided contrastive learning method. The method consists of two repeated steps across epochs. In each epoch, first identifies keywords in sentences that are crucial for predicting toxicity through feature attribution. Then it applies contrastive learning to separate samples that have common toxic keywords but different labels. Experiments show that our approach can mitigate lexical bias in toxic speech detection without any data augmentation or prior knowledge and achieve competitive performance gains.",,,,, ,  2023 International Conference on New Trends in Computational Intelligence (NTCI),Voice activity detection;Toxicology;Social networking (online);Self-supervised learning;Performance gain;Feature extraction;Task analysis;Toxic Speech;Bias Mitigation;Contrastive Learning;Feature Attribution

Studies on gene expression in intestinal cells revealed that there was a marked increase in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in mice exposed to whole-body 4 Gy gamma radiation, and that administration of CIE resulted in significant lowering of this ratio, suggestive of reduction of radiation-induced apoptosis. Also, in the intestinal tissue of irradiated animals, following CIE treatment, levels of expression of the DNA repair gene Atm were found to be elevated, and there was reduction in the expression of the inflammatory Cox-2 gene.

However, successful therapy also relies on identifying the extent of blood-brain barrier disruption, which is associated with excessive extra-cellular concentrations of ions, excitatory amino acids, and serum proteins. The following study investigates the use of pH-selective hydrous iridium oxide microelectrodes to assess trauma following insertion of a neural probe. Electrochemical activation of iridium microelectrode arrays was performed in either acidic (0.5 M H2SO4) or weak basic (0.3 M Na2HPO4, pH=8.56) solutions. Both oxides demonstrated super-Nernstian pH sensitivity (-88.5 mV/pH and -77.1 mV/pH, respectively) with little interference by other cations. Data suggest that acid-grown oxide provides better potential stability than base-grown oxide (sigma=2.8 versus 4.9 mV over 5 hours). Implantation of these electrodes into motor cortex and dorsal striatum revealed significant acidosis during and following insertion. Variability in the spatiotemporal pH profile included micro-scale inhomogeneities along the probe shank and significant differences in the averaged pH response between successive insertions using the same depth and speed. This diagnostic technology has important implications for intervention therapies in order to more effectively treat acute surgical brain trauma",,,,, ,  2006 International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,Microelectrodes;Medical treatment;Probes;Brain injuries;Amino acids;Proteins;Interference;Stability;Electrodes;Spatiotemporal phenomena

Perovskite-based photovoltaic (PV) cells are right now at the forefront of thin-film PV research and development due to their high-power conversion efficiency (PCE) and ease of manufacture. Perovskite materials based on Pb or Sn elements have been employed in the fabrication of solar cells. In instances of this nature, the utilization of tin-based inorganic PSCs can play a crucial role in advancing the performance of PSCs to exceptional levels. In this context, we want to present a theoretical exploration of a PV device known as a CsSnl3-based PSC, which possesses the desirable attributes of being lead-free, environmentally sustainable, and dependable. The present study involves the utilization of SCAPS software to conduct device modelling of PV cells based on CsSnl3. The bulk defect density of the buffer layer, specifically CsSnl3, has been altered from 1015 to 1018 cm-3. Based on the comprehensive findings, it can be shown that the PV CsSnl3 metrics exhibit maximum values when the defect density of CsSnl3-based PSC is reduced. When the concentration of faults reaches its minimum level of 1012 cm-3, the PV values exhibit enhancement as seen below: The observed results consist of a PCE of 23.3%, a VOC of 0.87V, a JSC of 30.76 mA/cm2, and an FF of 86.69%. These findings underscore the significance of mitigating the bulk defect density in CsSnl3-based PSCs in order to attain enhanced efficiency. Through additional investigation and advancement, it is plausible that PSCs devoid of lead, which rely on CsSnl3 as the active layer, could present a more environmentally friendly and enduring substitute for conventional lead-based PSCs.",,,,, ,"  2023 International Conference on Research Methodologies in Knowledge Management, Artificial Intelligence and Telecommunication Engineering (RMKMATE)",Photovoltaic systems;Performance evaluation;Toxicology;Photovoltaic cells;Lead;Perovskites;Software;SCAPS;CsSnI3;PCE;defect density;lead-free

As a result, it has become imperative to evaluate their proficiency in addressing issues such as toxicity, bias, and disinformation. However, current research focused on appraising and mitigating security risks has predominantly concentrated on specific facets, leading to disparities in evaluation criteria. In contrast, there has been relatively limited attention given to multidimensional and universal frameworks for security evaluation. In this context, this paper delves into the realm of generic evaluation frameworks for security that offer support for cross-language and multi-category analysis. We underscore the existing challenges associated with prominent large language models concerning security issues and develop a comprehensive test data set to furnish researchers with a tool for quantifying security aspects. Through comprehensive evaluations across three major benchmark tests, we identify distinct strengths and weaknesses exhibited by each open source large language model to varying degrees. By employing a multi-dimensional security evaluation framework, we can attain a more holistic comprehension of the performance exhibited by each model across diverse security dimensions.

Targeted therapies have varied success in addressing metastatic disease, due to their ability to penetrate certain physiological compartments. This paper considers an evolutionary cancer model that incorporates tumor cell growth, mutation and compartmental migration and leverages recent results on the optimal control of monotone and convex systems to synthesize switching treatment strategies where a single drug or a predetermined combination of drugs is used at a given time. The need for switching is motivated by clinical considerations such as the limited effectiveness of any single targeted therapy against multiple resistance mechanisms arising in a single patient and the inability to design drug combinations at effective doses due to toxicity constraints. An optimal and clinically feasible switching therapy is obtained as the solution of a convex optimization problem that exploits the diagonally-dominant structure of the model. We demonstrate that this method yields an effective strategy in mitigating disease evolution in the presence of imperfect drug penetration in two compartments on an experimentally identified model of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-rearranged lung carcinoma.",,,,, ,  2016 IEEE 55th Conference on Decision and Control (CDC),Drugs;Tumors;Switches;Convex functions;Optimal control;Physiology

Therefore, this study integrates optimal transport (OT), structure remapping (SR), and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) into a GNN-based CCT prediction model, CardiOT.

In very recent years, there has been a rapid evolution and multiform implementation of the so-called Artificial Intelligence. Notably, one significant development in AI is the creation of systems capable of performing tasks based on a set of established rules. Artificial Intelligence has recently undergone a significant revolution that has led to a radical paradigm shift, represented by the so-called Foundation Models, which have two main characteristics: emergence and homogenisation. On the other hand, Language Modelling (LM) is one of the main approaches to advance the linguistic intelligence of machines and thus a Foundation Model trained on textual data. The most recent development of this approach can be found in the so-called Large Language Models (LLM). These take the form of artificial neural networks pre-trained on huge datasets which, instead of being dedicated to a specific task, can perform a wide range of different functions at a level that is all the more accurate the greater the resources made available to them. The concept of language models is not new but has evolved with the progress of artificial intelligence over the decades. In general, LLMs are mainly trained in industrial settings where many important details of training (e.g. data collection and cleaning) are not disclosed. Thus, it is difficult to align LLMs with human values or preferences. Despite their capabilities, LLMs are also likely to produce toxic, fictitious or harmful content. Therefore, effective and efficient control approaches are required to eliminate the potential risk arising from the use of LLMs. For the purposes of the study conducted, it is intended to describe the development and outcomes with the aim to show not only the evolution of the responses offered by various LLM, but also and above all the possible ethical and legal implications that can be deduced from these outputs. Several models have been used for the implementation of the experiments: two GPT-2 models, Perplexity, ChatGPT (version 3.5), Llama. The language used for the implementation of the experiments was English, as it is structurally more neutral. In particular, with reference to a topic with a strong ethical and legal impact such as suicide, different answers were offered by the various models used. In conclusion, the essay offers reflections on the results of the experiment with reference to the EU Regulation on Artificial Intelligence. Artificial Intelligence represents for the jurist, not only European, a decisive challenge not only with regard to the categories of thought and formulation of operational languages, but above all with regard to the centrality of the human being. On the basis of these considerations, focusing on generative AI and in particular on Large Language Models, it is clear that many of the issues relating to copyright and the protection of personal data still remain unsolved, excluding those already regulated by the legislation on the point.",,,,, ,"  2024 IEEE International Conference on Metrology for eXtended Reality, Artificial Intelligence and Neural Engineering (MetroXRAINE)",Training;Ethics;Law;Foundation models;Large language models;Europe;Regulation;Reflection;Artificial intelligence;Protection;Artificial Intelligence;Large Language Models;Ethics;Law;Artificial Intelligence Act

While single-label classification problems have been thoroughly researched, the same cannot be said for MLC. A gradually increasing number of problems are now being tackled as multi-label, allowing for richer and more accurate knowledge mining in real-world domains, such as medical diagnoses, social media, text classification, etc. Currently, there are two ways of solving MLC problems; Problem Transformation Approach and Algorithm Adaptation Method. Of the two, the former has in its domain Classifier Chains (CC) which is the most effective and popular method of solving MLC problems because of its simplicity in implementation. Unfortunately, CC is not favoured due to 2 drawbacks, [1] ordering of the labels for classification are randomly decided without a fixed logic or algorithm to it which results in varying accuracy, [2] all the labels, even those which may be redundant for a particular dataset are put into the chain despite the probability that some may be carrying irrelevant details. Through the research conducted for the purpose of this study, both challenges are tackled along with others detailed further on simultaneously using Genetic Algorithms (GA) over a Partial CC (PartCC) model, which is a modification over CC. A toxic comments dataset is used since its classification is a multi-label text classification problem with a highly imbalanced dataset.

This paper presents a substructure-based classification algorithm that decouples the substructure discovery process from the classification model construction and uses frequent subgraph discovery algorithms to find all topological and geometric substructures present in the data set. The advantage of this approach is that during classification model construction, all relevant substructures are available allowing the classifier to intelligently select the most discriminating ones. The computational scalability is ensured by the use of highly efficient frequent subgraph discovery algorithms coupled with aggressive feature selection. Experimental evaluation on eight different classification problems shows that our approach is computationally scalable and, on average, outperforms existing schemes by 7 percent to 35 percent.",,,,, ,  ,Chemical compounds;Pharmaceuticals;Drugs;Filtering;Libraries;Classification algorithms;Biological system modeling;Solid modeling;Computational intelligence;Scalability;Index Terms- Classification;chemical compounds;virtual screening;graphs;SVM.

However, the surge in the number of devices and centralized management brings severe challenges to IoT, such as single point of failure, poor security, privacy leakage, and low reliability. Due to the decentralization, verifiability, and privacy protection of blockchain federated learning (BFL), some BFL schemes have been proposed to solve these problems, but bring new challenges, such as device privacy leakage and heavy security computing load. In this article, we propose a new decentralized, secure and verifiable consortium BFL privacy protection scheme, named LPBFL, which realizes lightweight computing while ensuring the privacy of the local model and data set of the device. To achieve lightweight privacy protection, LPBFL adopts the Paillier encryption and the newly designed lightweight digital signature and batch verification algorithm. Additionally, considering that devices upload invalid or even toxic local models intentionally or unintentionally, we design a device reputation selection mechanism to make BFL more efficient. Finally, the theoretical analysis proves the security of LPBFL and verifies the unforgeability of the proposed digital signature.

Despite these advances, real-time detection of such speech, while it is being shared on these platforms, remains a challenge for two reasons. First, these approaches train complex models on a plethora of features, which calls into question their computational efficiency for real-time deployment. Moreover, they require sizeable, manually annotated data sets from the same context, and annotating large data sets is extremely time-consuming, error-prone and cumbersome. This paper proposes a parsimonious and practical approach for the detection of offensive speech that alleviates these challenges. The approach is parsimonious because through a comprehensive evaluation of commonly used machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Neural Networks) on two public domain data sets it demonstrates that a simple Logistic Regression model trained on unigrams with frequency counts can detect hate speech with high accuracy of over 90%. It is practical because it demonstrates how an existing labeled training data set can be used to train models that can detect offensive content from a completely unknown data set with moderate accuracy. Based on these findings, the paper offers guidance on the characteristics that may be desirable in benchmark training data sets for offensive speech detection.",,,,, ,"  2021 International Conference on Computing, Communication, and Intelligent Systems (ICCCIS)",Voice activity detection;Social networking (online);Training data;Data models;Real-time systems;Random forests;Logistics;Offensive speech;Machine Learning;Detection.

Since these activities are dangerous for humans and animals, the studies that address employing robots to the activities have been increased in recent years. However, robots must have capabilities such as autonomous navigation and situation awareness to operate in dangerous search and rescue environments. The National Institute of Standards and Technology presents reference test arenas to measure mobile robots' autonomous navigation capability. The main motivation of this study is to compare PointNet, DGCNN, PointNet++, and PointCNN deep learning architectures for semantic classification of ramps that are placed in reference test arenas. Besides, the terrain and walls are considered since they carry essential information for navigation. To compare the architectures, the ESOGU RAMPS dataset was constructed and the architectures were trained and tested with the point cloud data that are situated in the dataset. The metric and visual test results were presented to analyze the positive and negative aspects of the architectures.",,,,, ,  2020 Innovations in Intelligent Systems and Applications Conference (ASYU),Robots;NIST;Deep learning;Three-dimensional displays;Standards;Semantics;Recurrent neural networks;point cloud;deep learning;NIST ramps;mobile robots
"Jung, Kathryn",,,Artificial Intelligence Approach for Predicting Class I Major Histocompatibility Complex Epitope Presentation and Neo-Epitope Immunogenicity,,,10.1109/ISEC61299.2024.10664816 , ,2024,"T cells help eliminate pathogens present in infected cells and help B cells make better and different kinds of antibodies to protect against extracellular microbes and toxic molecules. Because T cells cannot see the inside of cells to identify ones that ingested pathogens or are synthesizing viral or mutant proteins, antigen presentation systems evolved, displaying on the cell surface information about various antigens synthesized or ingested in cells. The systems provide a way to monitor major subcellular compartments where pathogens are present and report their presence to the appropriate T cells. Endogenously synthesized antigens in the cytosol of all cells are presented to CD8+ T cells as peptides bound to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, thereby allowing identification and elimination of infected cells or cancer cells by the CD8+ lymphocytes. Thus, identification of non-genetically encoded peptides, or neo-epitopes, eliciting an adaptive immune response is important to develop patient-specific cancer vaccines. However, experimental process of validating candidate neo-epitopes is very resourceintensive, and a large portion of candidates are found to be non-immunogenic, making the identification of successful neo-epitopes difficult and time-consuming. A recent study showed that the BigMHC method, composed of seven pan-allelic deep neural networks trained on peptide-MHC eluted ligand data from mass spectrometry assays and transfer learned on data from assays of antigen-specific immune response, significantly improves the prediction of epitope presentation on a test set of 45,409 MHC ligands among 900,592 random negatives compared to other four state-of-the-art classifiers. It also showed that after transfer learning on immunogenicity data, the precision of BigMHC is greater than several other state-of-the-art models in identifying immunogenic neo-epitopes, making BigMHC effective in clinical settings. I noticed that there is a multi-allelic dataset that comes from MHC-Flurry 2.0 consisting of MHC Class I peptides each with a bag of six alleles used in BigMHC method; in the single-allelic data, each peptide only consists of one allele instead of multi-alleles. However, even in the single-allelic data duplicates are possible: there may be two of the exact same peptides, but one belongs to one allele while the other belongs to a different allele. I set out examining such duplicates with my custom code and found that 44.734% of the singleallelic data are duplicates, raising the possibility that BigMHC method's test results is unaffected by the duplicates. As expected, there was no notable differences based on my trained models. The examination and result raise another possibility that implementing multiple instance learning (MIL) may be advantageous in immunogenicity prediction because it considers multiple MHC alleles associated with a given peptide, as observed in the multi-allelic dataset whereas in single-instance learning, each peptide is associated with a single label (in this case, whether it elicits an active immune response), which may not fully capture the complexity of MHC-peptide interactions due to the high level of polymorphism in MHC class I molecules. If the approach succeeds, MIL will help further enhance the accuracy and reliability of BigMHC method potentially more beneficial in clinical settings.",,,,, ,  2024 IEEE Integrated STEM Education Conference (ISEC),Proteins;Pathogens;Antigens;Peptides;Transfer learning;Mass spectroscopy;Vaccines

Nonylphenol is one of the very toxic breakdown products. The process of nonylphenol biodegradation is very important to many scientists because of its potential effectiveness as a treatment tool for pollution. However, very little information is available on the biodegradation kinetics of nonylphenol. Kinetic information is necessary for predicting the fate of pollutants. We start with Monod's model for nonylphenol biodegradation which is based on a coupled system of nonlinear differential equations. We prove that the states of the system and the parameters of Monod's model are locally observable. This enables us to perform a meaningful parameter estimation analysis.

As a result, the recycling movement has gained momentum as a measure to save it. Contemporarily, the recycling industry has not seen a major shift and the problems that existed decades earlier persist. Trash classification is at the core of these problems, because if you can’t classify it, obviously you can’t recycle it. Manual classification often leads to misclassification as humans classify or judge things based on their experiences, knowledge, and not just absolute facts. Additionally, if the waste to be sorted is toxic, being in direct contact may be physically harmful to the people involved. Until a solution is found for this problem, the recycling industry won’t be on par with the rise in recycling culture. Thus, this is the problem we have set out to solve; this paper proposes a Deep Learning model based on EfficientNet Architecture that can classify different kinds of trash with an accuracy high enough to make it a viable solution for the industry while using a comparatively lower number of parameters than existing methods. We achieved an accuracy of 98% on the TrashNet dataset, the standard data for Trash classification, and outperformed all existing models.

Even it spoils the environment to a great extent. Due to these, farmers are suffering huge losses. There are many reasons for this like the usage of more pesticides as these are very toxic and dangerous. If the diseases are predicted before, then these crop diseases can be removed or killed at the starting stage without causing much crop damage. Some people like experts can determine the disease by looking at the crop, that is by seeing external symptoms. But farmers don't have the connection with the experts. Our project deals with overcoming this problem by using concepts of artificial intelligence and cloud computing. The project goal is to predict crop disease. Farmers can use this project to predict crop disease at an earlier stage and get steps to remove the disease. We will develop an android app and a website that takes the cropped photo as input. Farmers should upload the affected crop images in the app, so those experts will observe the symptoms and predict the diseases.

It is essential to deal with water resource management urgently. In this article, researchers mainly focus on monitoring the water quality in the Lam Pa Thao dam, Chaiyaphum, Thailand. The farmer in that area directly affected by the water quality in the dam because they raise fish in floating fish cages. To prevent losses from fish farming, they should have the ability to monitor and control the factors that affect the water quality. As a result, the farmer can monitor the water quality and the monitor system can report to the farmer in time. In this case, to monitor the water quality, researchers designed the buoys, which is the internet of things device, to collect data from the Lam Pa Thao dam. researchers collected the water quality data from January - March 2021, including 13,608 instances. The five important parameters were obtained, including dissolved oxygen, temperature, pH, total dissolved solids, and electric conductivity. Due to the number of parameters, researchers decided not to apply dimension reduction. In these experiments, researchers proposed using K-means clustering algorithms to group the water data into appropriate clusters. For the K-Means algorithm, we calculated the silhouette coefficient to analyze the effectiveness of cluster separation. The best cluster that was grouped using the K-means algorithm achieved the silhouette score of 0.6839. Furthermore, researchers evaluated the K-means algorithm on Charles river and Fitzroy river datasets.

In order to curb the pollution caused by these brick kilns, it is very important to identify them. As part of this study, an analysis in the Delhi- NCR region is performed. An approach for mapping brick kiln locations by using various Machine Learning (ML) algorithms is presented in this work. The Sentinel-2 imagery with 10m resolution was used to create four classes, namely, built up, field, water, and brick kiln. It is possible to distinguish brick kilns from other classes by using the said dataset due to its unique spectral and geometric features. Several ML classifiers have been trained on the sentinel-2 dataset, including the Random Forest Classifier and four built-in classifiers of Google Earth Engine, such as Smile Random Forest, Smile CART (Classification and Regression Trees), Smile Gradient Tree Boost, and Smile Naive Bayes Classifier. In order to train the model based on different classifiers, 70% of data points are used for training and 30% for validation purposes. Among the machine learning classifiers, Smile Random Forest achieved the maximum accuracy of 96.4%. As a result of this study, an ML model has been proposed for the classification of brick kilns from Sentinel-2 imagery, and a comparative analysis has been done between the various ML models. The proposed ML model can classify brick kilns from Sentinel-2 images with an accuracy of 96.4%, precision of 0.88, and recall of 0.73.

However, in fluoroscopic images, visualization of the vasculature requires toxic contrast agent. Static vasculature roadmapping, which can reduce the usage of iodine contrast, is hampered by the breathing motion in abdominal catheterization. In this paper, we propose a method to track the catheter tip inside the patient’s 3D vessel tree using intra-operative single-plane 2D X-ray image sequences and a peri-operative 3D rotational angiography (3DRA). The method is based on a hidden Markov model (HMM) where states of the model are the possible positions of the catheter tip inside the 3D vessel tree. The transitions from state to state model the probabilities for the catheter tip to move from one position to another. The HMM is updated following the observation scores, based on the registration between the 2D catheter centerline extracted from the 2D X-ray image, and the 2D projection of 3D vessel tree centerline extracted from the 3DRA. The method is extensively evaluated on simulated and clinical datasets acquired during liver abdominal catheterization. The evaluations show a median 3D tip tracking error of 2.3 mm with optimal settings in simulated data. The registered vessels close to the tip have a median distance error of 4.7 mm with angiographic data and optimal settings. Such accuracy is sufficient to help the physicians with an up-to-date roadmapping.

These readings are used for energy management, load estimation, and billing. Nonetheless, malicious customers, who aim to lower their bills illegally, launch electricity theft cyberattacks by breaching their meters and reporting lower readings. These reported false readings are toxic to the grid’s reliability and performance because they are used in energy management, and hence causing financial losses and inefficient use of resources. Existing solutions present in the literature aim at securing billing only because they are designed to detect false readings in real-time. Therefore, the SO may continue to make use of these false readings for energy management and load monitoring for a long time until the detection is done. In this paper, we propose real-time detection of false readings using deep learning. We first create malicious and benign datasets generated from a sliding window and use them to train different deep learning models. The best-performing model is then trained on various ratios of the false readings.

When stress becomes constantly overwhelmed and prolonged, it increases the risk of mental health and physiological uneasiness. Furthermore, chronic stress raises the likelihood of mental health plagues such as anxiety, depression, and sleep disorder. Although measuring stress using physiological parameters such as heart rate variability (HRV) is a common approach, how to achieve ultra-high accuracy based on HRV measurements remains as a challenging task. HRV is not equivalent to heart rate. While heart rate is the average value of heartbeats per minute, HRV represents the variation of the time interval between successive heartbeats. The HRV measurements are related to the variance of RR intervals which stand for the time between successive R peaks. In this study, we investigate the role of HRV features as stress detection bio-markers and develop a machine learning-based model for multi-class stress detection. More specifically, a convolution neural network (CNN) based model is developed to detect multi-class stress, namely, no stress, interruption stress, and time pressure stress, based on both time- and frequency-domain features of HRV.

The viability of cardiomyocytes decreases significantly when treated with DOX and results in a cardiomyopathy mortality rate upwards of 50%, but this is reduced when encapsulated in a Poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) nanoparticle. We collected and treated murine cardiomyocytes in-vitro grouping untreated, DOX, and DOX with PLGA cells, and characterized them utilizing a fluorescence-activated cell sorting technique, cell flow cytometry. Using machine learning, we found which characteristics make PLGA effective at performing drug-carrying capabilities. We created a random forest model for processing the murine cells to predict which of the three treatments it received. We perform feature engineering utilizing correlation matrices between the features, Variation Inflation Factor (VIF) scores, and their Permutation Importance (PI) scores. Our random forest model achieved a 92.63% accuracy in predicting treatments with a dataset composed of highly independent features. By examining the most important features for the model’s accuracy, cell death, DOX, and granularity amount, we discern that because PLGA restores the lysosomal compartment of cells, it allows healthy cells to recycle their cytoplasmic structures. We also discovered that PLGA administers less of the toxic drug when cells are not tumorous, and restores the cellular membranes of cells after they are treated with DOX.",,,,, ,  2024 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM),Drugs;Nanoparticles;Analytical models;Accuracy;Correlation;Predictive models;Biomedical measurement;Biomembranes;Surfactants;Random forests;Drug delivery;Cardiotoxicity;Random Forest;PLGA

Precise assessment of rain-induced stress responses on wheat is crucial for implementing timely preventive measures to mitigate the damage. While traditional methods involve toxic chemicals and laborious processes, satellite data offers a quicker, easier, and eco-friendly alternative. This study explores the potential of Sentinel-2 data to monitor biochemical changes in wheat crops caused by random rainfall events. Over three years, satellite, drone, weather, and agronomic data were collected for wheat crops. Four datasets were integrated through a multi-step processing workflow: agronomic data were derived from laboratory analyses of leaf samples collected at different growth stages of the wheat crop; drone imagery was processed via mosaicking, orthorectification, and geo-registration; and Sentinel-2 data underwent atmospheric correction, resampling, and sub-setting to produce reflectance maps. Weather data, including rainfall patterns, were directly sourced from the Agromet Field Unit at IIT Roorkee, India. Vegetation indices were extracted from the satellite and drone data, and these indices were used to develop a partial least square regression (PLSR) model to predict eight key biochemical variables. During rainfall stress, the study observed significant biochemical shifts, with declines in chlorophyll, carbohydrate, protein, and lipid levels, and increases in phenol, proline, hydrogen peroxide, and superoxide dismutase. The PLSR model accurately captured these changes, achieving R2-values $\ge 0.7$ and root mean square error (RMSE) <0.12 for all variables except lipids. The results highlight the effectiveness of this approach in monitoring rain-induced stress on wheat crops, providing a non-invasive and reliable method for protecting grain quality and minimizing yield losses.

Climate change is creating environmental conditions suitable for harmful algal blooms (HAB) on a global scale. Some phytoplankton species can also release toxins, which may cause large-scale marine mortality with knock-on effects on coastal economies. Reliable phytoplankton monitoring and early HAB detection are also essential in climate-resilient solutions for aquaculture applications. Currently, phytoplankton monitoring is primarily based on traditional microscopy. However, it is time-consuming and requires an experienced taxonomist. There is a need to expedite and automate phytoplankton monitoring to support aquaculture industries. Analytical instruments based on microscopy coupled with artificial intelligence (AI) models may be vital to monitoring applications. Digital plankton data sets are usually imbalanced and reflect natural environmental differences. The lack of data to represent minority species/genera prevents AI models from understanding some taxa completely. It compromises system reliability for HAB monitoring applications. The present study investigates state-of-the-art models for class imbalance problems tailored for HAB monitoring within multi-trophic aquaculture farms from Brazil, South Africa, and Scotland.

In our study, machine learning aims to track changes in the toxicity of contaminated soils in order to predict the level of human health hazard of a contaminated soil condition. For this, the following tasks were set: 1) collection and analysis of data on the types of soil toxicity; 2) study of a mathematical model of toxicity to assess the level of resistance; 3) testing the concentration of toxic elements in soils using four machine learning algorithms. Four machine learning algorithms were tested in the article to predict the content of heavy metals in the soil. The results show that the use of machine learning algorithms allows achieving a high degree of prediction of harmful elements concentrations in soils, which can be useful for making decisions on managing pollution sites. Further improvement of data accuracy and selection of the model and algorithm can also increase the accuracy of prediction.

Only the sequence of amino acid and structural characteristics are used to predict the features. Then we construct a set of criteria from the set of features to be used to predict them such as iso-electric point(PI), aliphatic index, amino acid content, half life, grand average, instability index etc. After constructing features we estimate a range for each feature and establish them through hypothesis testing using statistical distribution.

These comments hinder seriously the construction of a safe and healthy network environment, leading to a great demand for automated methods which can effectively identify such harmful information and deal with it in a timely manner. To address this challenge, we propose a BERT-based deep learning method in this paper to rate the severity of toxic comments.

To assess the aspects that concur with the formation of toxic conversations, we provide a multi-platform comparison on Twitter and YouTube between the 2022 Italian Political Elections, representing a potentially polarising topic, and the Italian Football League, a topic close to the country's popular culture. We first probe structural and conversational toxicity differences by analyzing 257 K conversations (3.7 M posts, 1 M users) on both platforms. Then, we provide a machine learning approach that, by leveraging the previous features, identifies the presence of the following toxic comment in different stages of conversations. We show that football tends to exhibit lower toxicity levels than politics, with the latter producing more extended conversations that attract a broader audience and consequently fostering the polarization phenomenon. The implemented classifiers resulting from the conversation stage-based approach achieve state-of-the-art performances despite a restricted set of features.

To tackle this problem, many platforms have devised policies. But these policies require prior identification of the content that is inappropriate and offensive. Furthermore, the data contains various aspects of negativity, for example, a particular piece of comment can express, disgust, disbelief, and threat at the same time. It points that even the negativity/toxicity exhibited in a comment can have various facets. Hence, the challenge is to identify what exactly is exhibited in comments so that respective policies can be formulated and applied to penalize the offender. This study makes use of two approaches to identify these underlying toxicities in the comments. The first approach is to train separate classifiers against each facet of the toxicity in comments. The second approach deals with the problem as a multi-label classification problem. Different machine learning approaches including logistic regression, Naïve Bayes, and decision tree classification are employed to carry out this study. The dataset is taken from Kaggle and 10-fold cross-validation is used to report the robustness of the model. The study uses a novel preprocessing scheme that transforms the multi-label classification problem into the multi-class classification problem. The preprocessing strategy has shown a significant improvement in the accuracies when employed for simple classification models encouraging its use for other sophisticated models as well.

But the anonymity and absence of in-person communication on these platforms often encourage the spread of offensive remarks, which can be harmful to both people and communities. Before classifying comments as dangerous, natural language processing, or NLP, must first comprehend and assess textual data in order to identify feelings, patterns, and context that may be harmful. Tokenizing the comments, generating features for the classification model, and preprocessing the text input are all done in this instance using natural language processing approaches. Specific NLP methods such as sequence padding, text vectorization, and tokenization may be covered in more detail. This study combines the architectures of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to present a unique technique for categorizing harmful remarks. This study pre-processes the text data to eliminate noise and unnecessary information. Next, we use word embeddings to embed the comments into numerical vectors. Next, in order to capture the spatial and sequential relationships present in the text data, this study uses a hybrid model that combines CNN and LSTM layers. The CNN component assists in identifying local patterns and characteristics in the comments, while the LSTM component allows the model to comprehend the sequential flow of language. This study uses a publicly accessible dataset of labelled harmful remarks to train and assess the proposed model.

Deterioration of the environment by the depletion of natural resources such as air, soil and water cause environmental degradation. When the temperature gets high, the climatic change leads an increase in the ozone layer, air pollutant. Due to these disruptions, the conditions of the living beings are getting changed. To maintain the proper temperature and climatic conditions, the usage of carbon, fuels, plastics and non biodegradable products has to be prohibited. Due to the emission of harmful air pollutants, the climatic change is getting changed accordingly. Contaminating the air can damage the air quality in the environment. Hence, the air quality and the climatic change play a vital role in the environment aspect. For detecting the various climatic condition states and the air quality, the variations over the dataset have to be predicted. By predicting those values, the use of non biodegradable products can be decreased. For the prediction and classifying the training dataset, machine learning approach is implemented. By using the supervised learning approach, the dataset can be classified by predicting the condition state. The use of this approach is to take initiative and precautionary step of reducing the non biodegradable products which are used.

The text data is transformed into numerical representations that retain the meaning of the words and phrases, such as word embeddings or sentence embeddings. These representations are then fed into a deep learning model that has been trained to distinguish between toxic and non-toxic comments using a labeled dataset of comments. The model modifies its parameters based on the discrepancy between its predictions and the actual labels during training. After training is finished, a different dataset is used to test the model's performance in identifying harmful remarks.

Plant health monitoring and disease detection are essential for sustainable agriculture. To protect plants against pathogen damage, farmers must be able to detect an infection prior to its obviousness. Effective plant disease detection technique can greatly lessen the use of toxic chemicals thereby aiding a better environment. For diseases to be managed effectively, plant pathogens must be accurately detected. The pathogens that cause plant diseases include bacteria, fungi, viruses, oomycetes, nematodes, phytoplasmas, protozoa, and parasitic plants. In this paper pathogen-based plant disease detection is done. An automated plant disease detection and its classification are done along with identifying the pathogen responsible for it using keras transfer learning models. This is done by considering Agri-ImageNet dataset as well as images of leaves, bulb, and flowers of sunflower and cauliflower captured in a natural realistic environment. This dataset overcomes the drawback of PlantVillage dataset in which images are captured in homogeneous backgrounds and controlled settings. These problems can be solved by reusing knowledge representations through deep transfer learning. Main objective of this paper is to explore and analyze all the deep transfer learning models, to identify which model is best suited for plant disease dataset. This work has been carried out by using 38 deep transfer learning models to obtain best classification accuracy.

The findings reveal that the DF21 model’s performance fluctuates with varying retained PCs. Furthermore, the fluctuations are influenced by the heavy metal’s type and its concentration distribution. As a result, the optimal performances for inverting the Zn and Cr concentrations appear at the first nine PCs and first eight PCs, respectively.

Although the social media platforms were originally designed to share information/news or connect families and friends, they also spread fake news, conspiracy theories, hate speech and cyberbullying. Cyberbullying is bullying with the use of digital technologies which is repeated, aimed at scaring, angering or shaming those who are targeted. Feeling vulnerable, powerless, humiliated, isolated, depressed or suicidal are examples of the negative effects from cyberbullying. Unfortunately, study has shown that one-third of the students have experienced cyberbullying in their lifetime. To mitigate this problem, we propose 1) a novel dataset of 67K tweets collected from Twitter, 2) automatic annotation methods for a large-scale dataset and 3) a detection system that to identify these toxic behaviours.

Such unintentional biases are especially disconcerting when they disadvantage or misrepresent identities already vulnerable in online spaces. Addressing this complex landscape, our research presents a model meticulously designed to detect toxic comments, aiming to achieve a higher degree of accuracy while striving to minimize such unintended biases. Our approach is underpinned by a combination of a tailored data preprocessing technique and the integration of Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM) with Attention mechanisms. Preliminary evaluations reveal our model's AVC score to be 0.93524, indicating its efficacy in toxicity detection.

Recently, a specific group of gestures, so-called Micro-gestures (MGs), has drawn increasing research interests in the community, as they can be useful cues to interpret human inner feelings. In this study, we focused on recognizing MG via self-supervised learning from skeleton sequences with several contributions. Initially, we observed that existing data augmentation methods for skeleton data always fail in MG representation learning. Our investigation shows that the failure is caused by the inherent properties of real-world datasets, such as imbalanced/long-tail data distribution, intra-class ambiguity, and inter-class heterogeneity. Thus, we propose a novel prior-guided augmentation strategy that can preserve the original data distribution while maximizing the agreement between samples in self-supervised learning. Furthermore, we proposed a three-stream architecture of self-supervised presentation learning for micro-gestures via spatial/temporal masking to jointly enhance the learning of invariant features.

Social media is captivating in this digital age through the accessibility of consumer's feedback. The recent work in the field of classification based on comments on social media is gaining appeal on a global scale.

On social media platforms, hateful and abusive language has a detrimental effect on users' mental health and involvement from people from all diverse backgrounds. Automatic methods is most commonly used datasets with categorical labels to detect foul language. The level of offensiveness of comments varies. In NLP we use binary classification like either a comment is offensive or not and leave continues classification. In continues classification one can identify the severity level of comments, can set a threshold, and by using Deep Learning and modeling techniques can directly identify the severity level of comments by considering context. The review of related literature shows that identification of toxicity of user comments can be improved by pre-processing methods, such as deleting null values and anomies from the dataset, to refine the dataset and increase its accuracy by applying different algorithm techniques to make feature more valuables. This research provides analysis of user comments datasets and study's user comments toxicity with different machine learning approaches.

Toward seamless knowledge transfer among tasks, effective representation of the data is a critical but yet not fully explored research area for the data engineer and data miner.

In this article, we have presented a novel deep learning based evaluation strategy that will identify the pollutant vehicle through on- road installed surveillance camera images. An enhanced image data set with notable variations has been prepared for training the models. Thereafter, a multi-model feedback process has been integrated. In contrast to the other deep learning approaches, the proposed framework has started with low labeled training data which is quite relevant in real-life scenarios. Subsequently, the size of the training samples has been increased using feedback. The evaluation of the framework has been performed with seven popular deep learning CNN models, i.e Inception-V3, MobileNet-V2, MobileNet-V3 (small), InceptionResNet-V2, VGG16, VGG19 and XceptionNet.

While it facilitates global communication and trade, it also brings significant negative impacts, such as the spread of toxic comments that can lead to severe consequences, including mental distress and, in extreme cases, suicide. This study centers on classifying toxic comments by utilizing three different machine learning models: the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Classifier, the baseline Support Vector Machine (SVM), and an Optimized SVM model. A dataset comprising text comments in both Bangla and English, collected from various social media platforms, was used to train these models. The initial SVM model, while powerful, showed limitations, particularly in handling class imbalance, leading to suboptimal performance. The SGD Classifier provided a balanced approach but fell short in recall for non-harmful comments. To address these challenges, an Optimized SVM model was developed by fine-tuning key hyperparameters, significantly enhancing the model's performance. The optimized model achieved superior accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores across both harmful and non-harmful comment classifications. Our results demonstrate that the Optimized SVM model is the most reliable and effective among the three, making it the preferred choice for deployment in real-world scenarios where accurate classification of toxic comments is critical.",,,,, ,"  2024 International Conference on Innovation and Intelligence for Informatics, Computing, and Technologies (3ICT)",Support vector machines;Technological innovation;Accuracy;Toxicology;Social networking (online);Stochastic processes;Machine learning;Vectors;Reliability;Informatics;Toxic Comment;SDG Classifier;Support Vector Machine;Native Language

In India alone, 35% of field crops are lost to pathogens and pests causing losses to farmers. Indiscriminate use of pesticides is also a serious health concern as many are toxic and biomagnified. These adverse effects can be avoided by early disease detection, crop surveillance and targeted treatments. Most diseases are diagnosed by agricultural experts by examining external symptoms. However, farmers have limited access to experts. Our project is the first integrated and collaborative platform for automated disease diagnosis, tracking and forecasting. Farmers can instantly and accurately identify diseases and get solutions with a mobile app by photographing affected plant parts. Real-time diagnosis is enabled using the latest Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms for Cloud-based image processing. The AI model continuously learns from user uploaded images and expert suggestions to enhance its accuracy. Farmers can also interact with local experts through the platform. For preventive measures, disease density maps with spread forecasting are rendered from a Cloud based repository of geo-tagged images and micro-climactic factors. A web interface allows experts to perform disease analytics with geographical visualizations. In our experiments, the AI model (CNN) was trained with large disease datasets, created with plant images self-collected from many farms over 7 months. Test images were diagnosed using the automated CNN model and the results were validated by plant pathologists. Over 95% disease identification accuracy was achieved.

Particularly in the predictive toxicology domain, because of the heterogeneity of data sources, multiple data instances with respect to the same endpoint are usually inconsistent, and the quality (or reliability) of the data instances is typically different. Also, the quantity of data instances is often not sufficient to conduct a study using conventional statistics-based methods. This paper presents a novel risk analysis approach for chemical toxicity assessment which considers all the available heterogeneous data instances in the same time, assisted by their quality (or reliability) values. The system is developed on the basis of possibility-probability distribution, where the uncertainty of the approximated probability values based on traditional statistics methods is represented by possibility. The uncertainty considered herein is led not only by the statistics on limited small number of data instances, but also by the poor quality (or reliability) of data instances. The possibility-probability distribution is automatically computed from available data instances by employing a modified diffused-interior-outer-set model (where the reliability of data is considered) based on information diffusion theory. Toxicity value for a given chemical compound is then estimated as the fuzzy expected value based on the resulted possibility-probability distribution. Toxicity risk with respect to regulatory threshold is also introduced, in order to evaluate the probability of which the toxicity may be classified into a certain regulatory range. The proposed approach is applied to a real-world dataset to illustrate the utility and the potential of the approach in risk assessment of chemical toxicity.",,,,, ,  2013 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE),Reliability;Mathematical model;Equations;Uncertainty;Chemicals;Chemical compounds;Possibility-probability distribution;information integration;toxicity risk analysis

An example is to predict the toxicity of chemical compounds using their structural properties as features represented by graphs. A popular method to classify these graphs is to exploit classifiers such as support vector machines (SVMs) and graph kernels to incorporate the sequential, structural and chemical information. Previous works have focused on designing specific graph kernels for this task, amongst which graph alignment kernels are one of the most popular approach. Graph alignment kernels align the nodes of one graph to the nodes of the second graph so that the total overall similarity is maximized with respect to all possible alignments. However, taking both vertex and edge similarities into account makes the problem NP-Hard. In this paper, we present a novel general graph-matching based method for QSAR. We view the problem of calculating optimal assignments of two attributed graphs from a different perspective. Instead of first designing an atom kernel function and a bond kernel function, we first provide a training set of pairs of graphs with their corresponding matchings. We then try to learn the compatibility function over atoms and use only the atom kernel function to compute graph matchings. Our algorithm has the advantage of being more general and yet efficient than previous approaches for the QSAR problem. We evaluate our method on a set of chemical structure-activity prediction benchmark datasets, and show that our algorithm can achieve better or comparable accuracies over the optimal assignment kernel method.",,,,, ,  2010 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology,Kernel;Chemical compounds;Support vector machines;Drugs;Biology computing;Training data;Machine learning algorithms;Decision trees;Logistics;Regression tree analysis

In particular, we exploit the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon during the process of continual learning to destroy the memory of the global model.

The first component prioritizes the weights that have the most influence on the model accuracy for poisoning, which induces a more significant degradation on the global model than equally perturbing all weights. The second component smooths malicious model updates based on the number of selected compromised clients in the current round, adjusting the degree of poisoning to suit the dynamics of each training round.

In this view, this study has been carried out to use machine learning techniques to classify comments into their hazardous categories. In order to categorize a comment based on its toxicity, this research compares classic machine learning methods with deep learning methods including Logistic Regression, SVM, RNN, and LSTM. To compare the performance of the models, four distinct models are developed, put into use, and trained on a common dataset. These models were developed and evaluated using sizable amounts of secondary qualitative data that included several comments that were either labeled as harmful or not. Results showed that employing LSTM, a satisfactory accuracy of 90.7% and an F1- score of 0.94 were obtained.",,,,, ,  2023 IEEE International Conference on ICT in Business Industry & Government (ICTBIG),Support vector machines;Deep learning;Logistic regression;Toxicology;Social networking (online);Text categorization;Government;Long-Short Term Memory;Recurrent Neural Network;Text mining;Toxic text classification;Text classification

In this paper, we show that state-of-the-art text-to-image generative models are in fact highly vulnerable to poisoning attacks. Our work is driven by two key insights. First, while diffusion models are trained on billions of samples, the number of training samples associated with a specific concept or prompt is generally on the order of thousands. This suggests that these models will be vulnerable to prompt-specific poisoning attacks that corrupt a model’s ability to respond to specific targeted prompts. Second, poison samples can be carefully crafted to maximize poison potency to ensure success with very few samples.We introduce Nightshade, a prompt-specific poisoning attack optimized for potency that can completely control the output of a prompt in Stable Diffusion’s newest model (SDXL) with less than 100 poisoned training samples. Nightshade also generates stealthy poison images that look visually identical to their benign counterparts, and produces poison effects that ""bleed through"" to related concepts. More importantly, a moderate number of Nightshade attacks on independent prompts can destabilize a model and disable its ability to generate images for any and all prompts. Finally, we propose the use of Nightshade and similar tools as a defense for content owners against web scrapers that ignore opt-out/do-not-crawl directives, and discuss potential implications for both model trainers and content owners.",,,,, ,  2024 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP),Training;Procurement;Data privacy;Toxicology;Text to image;Training data;Diffusion models

This method has significant potential for early diagnosis and accurate analysis of diseases. Emission from breath contains several volatile organic compounds. Among them, ammonia is a very commonly found VOC and mainly responsible for chronic kidney diseases. There exist several strategies to detect ammonia, however they demonstrate severe limitations such as cross-sensitivity and poor selectivity. This work demonstrates the synergistic effect of sensor functionalization and application of machine learning for selective detection of ammonia in the environment. The sensor exhibits high degree of selectivity towards ammonia owing to enormous hydroxyl groups contributed through curcumin. At 500 ppm ammonia, the sensor demonstrates 274% response and very high selectivity among seven volatile organic compounds. The machine learning models were trained with the help of sensor transients. Random Forest and CNN models were applied to predict the presence of ammonia in a mixture. Random Forest achieved 96.25% accuracy compared to 89% accuracy of CNN.

The domestic environment is engulfed with many trash items such as solid and toxic trashes, leading to severe environmental contamination and causing life-threatening diseases if not appropriately managed. Trash classification is at the heart of these issues because the inability to classify the trash leads to difficulty in recycling. Humans categorize trash based on what they understand about the trash object rather than on the recyclability status of an object, which frequently leads to incorrect classification in manual classification. Additionally, coming into contact with toxic waste directly could be physically dangerous for those involved. Few machine learning and Deep Learning (DL) techniques were proposed using benchmarked trash classification datasets. However, most benchmarked datasets used to train DL models have a transparent or white background, which leads to a lack of model generalization, particularly in the real world.

PAH can be found in our ecosystem such as air, water, soil, marine and in various food products. Excess presence of PAH is toxic to the environment and leads to carcinogenic effects on the organisms. Further, the presence of PAHs has been observed in aquatic systems which is the result of influent and effluent from wastewater treatment plants, seawater, surface water and ground water. Due to their high affinity and low solubility properties for particulates, PAH concentrations are less in water. However, the toxic nature of the water can be identified based on the concentration limit set by European standards and expert knowledge. Therefore, in this research it is proposed to detect the presence of toxicity in the water based on the PAHs. There are multiple methods to measure the PAH level like Gas chromatography /Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) and High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), but the detection of toxicity is through experimental analysis or expert knowledge. In this consideration, an investigative study has been conducted on the PAHs and the extracted feature sets were formed to evaluate through nonlinear machine learning algorithms such as Artificial Neural Networks.

Tobacco stems are used as the main raw material for reconstituted tobacco, but they contain a large number of small broken impurities mainly from cigarette butts, which are difficult to remove efficiently by air selection and manual methods. Detection schemes for cigarette butt impurities based on computer vision and deep learning are still difficult. The scarcity of images containing foreign impurities in cigarette butts and the small size of impurities limit the efficient application of deep learning algorithms. In view of the small impurities’ characteristics, this paper optimizes the model structure of the YOLOv7 algorithm, and only retains the two detection head structures with high feature resolution, which reduces the model parameters by 29.68%.

As isolation strategy with quarantine is useful to prevent transmission, students remaining at home gained nothing but illness perception, anxiety, and depression in spite of sharpening their knowledge and reflecting the thoughts. The detachment from routine life has affected the pillars of the mental health balance and isolated and suffocating lives have created toxic feelings in lives. Therefore the purpose of our paper is to predict the mental health of students in such situations. To accomplish our work, we have collected the students' mental health survey dataset from the Kaggle website later trained the data with suitable classifiers to predict mental health.

Aim at such small sample modeling problem, a soft measuring method based on selective ensemble (SEN) least square support vector machine (LSSVM) for modeling DXN emission concentration is proposed. At first, candidate training sub-samples are produced from original training samples. Then, different candidate sub-sub-models based on the same kernel parameter and regularization parameter are constructed by using LSSVM. Thirdly, ensemble sub-models are selected by using the genetic algorithm optimization tool box and prior knowledge.

The rapid growth of cyanobacteria can lead to Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs), posing major threats to water quality and aquatic ecosystems. Rapid and accurate identification of cyanobacteria is essential for population monitoring and mitigation efforts, especially when cyanobacteria produce toxins, threatening the health of wildlife and humans. However, the diverse shapes and appearances of cyanobacteria render manual identification time-consuming and error-prone. In this study, we make multiple novel contributions to the field of microscopic cyanobacterial identification using computer vision algorithms. To begin, we utilize the YOLOv5 algorithm, known for its speed and accuracy, which has never been evaluated for its efficacy in this field. Additionally, we propose numerous methods of addressing limited dataset size and image heterogeneity. We use various image pre-processing techniques, including color-preserving CLAHE. We also construct a comprehensive dataset containing several genera of cyanobacteria by supplementing laboratory images with opensource database images for training and evaluation. To combat overfitting and avoid unrealistic model performance values, we evaluate detection performance on common microscope artifacts (detritus and water bubbles), incorporate “background images”, which contain unrelated microorganisms into the dataset, and utilize image augmentation conservatively. Finally, hyperparameter tuning was used with a genetic algorithm to optimize a specified fitness function. The final model outperformed the Faster R-CNN model used in previous literature, achieving average precision values ranging from 70% to 90% for five commonly found, toxin-producing cyanobacteria taxa in the USA, representing state-of the-art performance and great potential for usage by biologists investigating HABs.",,,,, ,"  2023 IEEE 14th Annual Ubiquitous Computing, Electronics & Mobile Communication Conference (UEMCON)",Training;Microscopy;Biological system modeling;Wildlife;Sociology;Water quality;Water conservation;cyanobacteria;HABs;machine learning;CNN;YOLO framework

In order to minimise the risk of adverse reactions from drug interactions, doctors need to understand the properties of each drug and provide appropriate dosing instructions based on the patient’s individual circumstances. In order to allow physicians to quickly extract drug-drug relationships, drug-drug interaction relationship extraction techniques need to be studied and analysed to establish a medical drug information base to assist physicians in accessing important information about drug-drug relationships and avoiding adverse drug interactions. This paper proposes a new algorithm for drug interaction relationship extraction, with two main studies covering the following aspects: (1) To address the problems of multiple meanings of words in relationship extraction, high computational complexity, low training efficiency and low generalization ability, this paper proposes a new model BERT-GRU based on recurrent neural network and BERT. in order to eliminate the influence of Chinese word separation ambiguity on entity relationship classification, the BERT is introduced as an embedding layer to better obtain the contextual information of Chinese characters; then The long-distance dependencies of entities in the sentences are captured by gated loop units and output to the Sigmoid layer for classification, so as to obtain better entity relationship classification results. (2) By comparing and analysing the experimental results of the BERT-GRU model with other models, the BERT-GRU model showed better performance on the drug-interaction relationship extraction task, especially achieving higher F1 values for relationships of advice, mechanism and int types. The BERT-GRU model performed even better compared to several other common models. This suggests that the combination of BERT and GRU is very effective in the drug interaction relationship extraction task. In summary, through a series of experimental comparisons, the BERT-GRU model proposes in this paper can effectively solve the problems of inability to distinguish between polysemous words and low training efficiency, and provides a more effective method for drug interaction relationship extraction.",,,,, ,  2023 7th International Symposium on Computer Science and Intelligent Control (ISCSIC),Drugs;Deep learning;Analytical models;Feature extraction;Data mining;Task analysis;Context modeling;relational extraction;BERT;GRU

It helps students improve their understanding of reading materials, metacognitively monitor their comprehension, and self-correct comprehension gaps. Internet technologies have been used to facilitate SQG process through intensive peer support. However, the availability, level of task commitment, and capabilities of student peers have emerged as significant concerns, particularly in light of the global pandemic and the subsequent postpandemic era. Thus, this article presents a student–artificial intelligence (AI) cocreation tool called CoAsker for supporting question generation. Following recent human-computer interaction (HCI) research in human-AI collaborative writing, CoAsker first allows students to provide question clues and answers and then uses a state-of-the-art pretrained language model, T5-PEGASUS, to generate questions. Finally, the student can use this AI question directly or perform reflection by comparing his or her questions with the AI question. An empirical study was conducted to examine the quality of AI questions and the effect of this tool on student engagement and reading comprehension. The results of the study show that students using this tool (treatment) were more engaged in generating low-level cognitive questions and performed better in acquiring knowledge than those using a traditional online question generation tool (control). These results indicate that student-AI question cocreation is beneficial to SQG training and educational assessment for reading comprehension, such as repeated practices.",,,,, ,  ,Writing;Artificial intelligence;Computational modeling;Task analysis;Internet;Human computer interaction;Federated learning;Authoring systems;educational technology;natural language processing

Studying the evolution of this remarkable system from an architectural perspective can provide insights on how to manage the growth of large, complex, and long-lived software systems. Along main Unix releases leading to the FreeBSD lineage we examine core architectural design decisions, the number of features, and code complexity, based on the analysis of source code, reference documentation, and related publications. We report that the growth in size has been uniform, with some notable outliers, while cyclomatic complexity has been religiously safeguarded. A large number of Unix-defining design decisions were implemented right from the very early beginning, with most of them still playing a major role. Unix continues to evolve from an architectural perspective, but the rate of architectural innovation has slowed down over the system's lifetime. Architectural technical debt has accrued in the forms of functionality duplication and unused facilities, but in terms of cyclomatic complexity it is systematically being paid back through what appears to be a self-correcting process. Some unsung architectural forces that shaped Unix are the emphasis on conventions over rigid enforcement, the drive for portability, a sophisticated ecosystem of other operating systems and development organizations, and the emergence of a federated architecture, often through the adoption of third-party subsystems. These findings have led us to form an initial theory on the architecture evolution of large, complex operating system software.",,,,, ,  ,Computer architecture;Complexity theory;Evolution (biology);Linux;Kernel;Unix;software architecture;software evolution;architecture design decisions;operating systems

The process of drug delivery can be modelled in a blood flow-based MC system, where nanoparticles (NPs) carry therapeutic agents through the blood vessel channels to the targeted diseased tissue. Most previous studies in the flow-based MC consider a Newtonian fluid with a laminar flow, which ignores the influence of red blood cells (RBCs). However, the nature of blood flow is a complex and non-Newtonian fluid composed of proteins, platelets, plasma and deformable cells, especially RBCs. The ability to change their shapes is essential to the proper functioning of RBCs in the microvasculature. Different shapes of RBCs have a great impact on the performance of blood flow. Changes in the properties and shapes of RBCs are often associated with different diseases, such as sickle cell anemia, diabetes, and malaria. Thus, it is highly important to establish a more realistic blood flow MC model considering the deformable cells. According to our previous study, the motion and adhesion of individual NPs are modelled through the Brownian adhesion dynamics. Subsequently, this paper establishes a particle-cell hybrid model in the flow-based MC, which focuses on the RBC deformation, aggregation, and dispersion in the blood suspension. Based on the state of the RBC deformation and aggregation in the vessels with different flow rates, this paper proposes a novel methodology for detecting the deformability of the cells. The blood state in terms of RBC deformability is determined by the difference in NPs’ concentration at the receiving end., this paper sheds some light on the influence of RBCs on the motion of NPs, which provides new insights on the design of targeted drug delivery and the detection of vascular diseases.",,,,, ,  ,Red blood cells;Molecular communication (telecommunication);Cells (biology);Blood vessels;Viscosity;Nanoparticles;Flow-based molecular communications;blood vessel;red blood cell deformation;red blood cell aggregation

However, the current research on cyberbullying detection has been limited to binary/multi-class text classification due to the lack of comprehensive datasets for training and evaluation. To address this gap, we developed a DL-based multi-labeled cyberbully detection system using a dataset of 95,608 social media comments. These comments were categorized into five distinct multi-labeled classes, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of the different dimensions of cyberbullying. We utilized DL architectures, such as LSTM, BiLSTM, CLSTM, and BiGRU, to develop advanced cyberbully detection systems. By comparing the performance of these DL models with the ML models, we were able to assess the effectiveness and superiority of DL approaches in accurately identifying instances of cyberbullying contents.

Research on microplastics meets on human health risk regarding possibilities of microplastics exposure, which causes the issue more concern to be studied. On this research, we investigated the total of microplastics contaminant from a seafood product, the anchovies (Stolephorus spp.) from Alor and Balikpapan harbors. The digestive tract of anchovies are isolated and measured as length (cm±SD) and dry weight (g±SD). The anchovies digestive tracts (±1 g) were added with 30 mL (1 M) NaOH together with 15 mL 0.5% dissolved Sodium Lauryl Sulphate (technical grade) and kept at room temperature within a week. Microplastics is observed with microscope Leica and confirmed by Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) analysis. The results reveal that the anchovies from Alor carried out 302±1.0 particles microplastic/individual, followed by 130±1.73 particles microplastic/individual from Balikpapan' anchovies. The most shape and size found on a sample from Alor were 95% microfiber with 50-500 μm, while from Balikpapan sample were 43.83% microfilm with 20-50 μm, The mercury contamination is also tested. The results showed that mercury are not detected from the Alor sample and a little bit from Balikpapan sample (39.49 ug/L or 0.04 mg/Kg). Although mercury is present from Balikpapan sample, the amount is under the maximum level (0.06 mg/Kg) based on BPOM RI standard. To better understand the microplastics and mercury contamination on the anchovies product originate from Indonesia Sea, the future study which provides more sampling location is needed.",,,,, ,  2019 IEEE R10 Humanitarian Technology Conference (R10-HTC)(47129),Contamination;Shape;Pollution measurement;Standards;Chemicals;Water pollution;microplastics;mercury;pollution;anchovies

Sánchez",,,Photoinitiator Release of Photoprinted SLA Resins for Lab-on-a-chip Applications,,,10.1109/EHB55594.2022.9991420 , ,2022,"3D printing with SLA resins is a very useful manufacturing process to build microfluidic devices (lab-on-a-chip). These photoresin-based methods are especially interesting, as they allow to obtain quickly and accurately high precise designs. However, commercial photoresins have some limitations for cell culture due to its composition. In this sense, photoinitiators used for curing these resins are commonly cytotoxic. Although curing and cleaning protocols are used to remove these components from printed pieces, they could still remain in enough quantity to compromise cell culture on lab-on-a-chips. For this reason, a continuous phase in a solid-liquid extraction has been studied using two media (IPA and PBS) to determine the photoinitiator release of two different resins (Clear and BioMedClear) along 16 days. So, detection, identification and quantification of the released compounds were done by UV-Vis spectroscopy each two days during this period. Results show spectra of TPO and PPO photoinitiators. Additionally, curing and cleaning protocols do not fully remove these toxic compounds, but IPA provides better solvent properties to release these photoinitiator molecules than PBS. In conclusion, lab-on-a-chip applications of SLA resins require specific post-processing to minimize toxicity due to release of photoinitiators.",,,,, ,  2022 E-Health and Bioengineering Conference (EHB),Solvents;Spectroscopy;Protocols;Toxicology;Curing;Lab-on-a-chip;Three-dimensional printing;Photoinitiator;SLA resin;lab-on-a-chip;toxicity;cell culture

Graphene-based electronics provide new opportunities for flexible electronics because of their superior properties including high electrical conductivity, high mechanical flexibility, high carrier mobility, and so forth. In this work, a water-dispersible graphene paste (WGP) was used as raw materials to fabricate flexible conductive patterns and films on various substrates. The water dispersions have noteworthy advantages over those obtained in organic solvents, such as low cost, absence of solvent toxicity and capacity for green chemistry compatibility with hydrophilic substrates, also avoiding post-reduction of graphene oxide (GO) to obtain electrical conductivity. The microstructures and rheological properties of the WGP were firstly studied. Then, the WGP with a high concentration of 20 mg mL-1 was directly printed on flexible substrates such as paper and PET film by a simple and low-cost stencil printing method to obtain various printed patterns. The electrical properties and durability of the printed patterns were investigated under different deformations such as bending and folding. The printed conductive patterns show a good conductivity and which can be visually demonstrated by lighting a LED bulb with a 3 V power source. The WGP conductive line on paper exhibits excellent electrical stability (~5% of relative change of resistance) after 1500 bending cycles. Moreover, after dilution of the WGP to a low concentration of 2 mg mL-1, it can be used to fabricate a flexible conductive film on PET substrate by spray coating technology, and which shows a low sheet resistance of ~14.33 Ω sq-1 at a thickness of ~5 μm.

The goal of the project was to evaluate the effectiveness of using luminescent bacteria as ""canaries"" for rapid non-specific detection of toxic contaminants for homeland food protection and defense. Vibro fischeri was used as the specific biological sensor in this study. The bacteria was grown in marine broth and maintained between 22 and 25degC for optimal growth. Cultures were used to determine the presence of a surrogate toxicant, in this case, sodium hypochlorite (bleach) in various concentrations.

The NIR-II window can be further divided into two spectral regions: NIR-IIa (1,000-1,300 nm) and NIR-IIb (1,500-1,700 nm). Compared to NIR-IIa, imaging in NIR-IIb region affords high-resolution imaging at subcentimeter tissue depths due to suppressed photon scattering and diminished tissue autofluorescence at long wavelengths, but relies on probes with high toxicity. To address the problem, researchers employ deep learning networks to attain NIR-IIb images from NIR-IIa images. However, current methods require numerous paired or unpaired images (more than 2800 images) as training sets, which can hardly acquire. In this work, an innovative convolutional neural network (BRCycle-GAN) is trained based on a small training set (merely 63 images) to transform NIR-IIa images into images with NIR-IIb imaging qualities.

An undesirable consequence of this rapid expansion is the alarming rise of misinformation that is spreading throughout social networks and publishing platforms. Fact verification is the act of verifying the correctness of a particular statement. Manual fact-checkers find it increasingly difficult to keep up with the rapid proliferation of fake news in the information ecosystem. Fact verification pipelines aim at assisting the fact-checkers. These pipelines involve retrieving potentially relevant documents for a given claim, checking the reliability of the document media sources, evaluating the significance of each document, and verifying the correctness of given claims. However, there are a few limitations to these pipelines. The first limitation is that they treat fact verification as a stance detection or textual entailment task and places less emphasis on pure reasoning as the basis of fact verification. The second limitation is the robustness of the models. The fact verification models do not perform well on real-world data due to the text constructed using a myriad of complex ways. The reason for low accuracy is due to the evaluation and training of models on synthetic data that does not resemble the real-world data.

In the current study, we performed a systematic review of literature to examine the influent sewage concentrations of erythromycin (prescription antibiotic) and ibuprofen (over-the counter pain reliever) in municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). The literature search and screening procedure yielded datasets from a total of 250 WWTPs which were grouped according to plant capacity (small, <; 10 mega gallons per day, MGD; medium, 10-100 MGD; and large, > 100 MGD) and geographic location (Asia, Europe, North America). Measured erythromycin levels in the influent ranged from 10-1 μ g/L to 1 μ g/L, while ibuprofen levels ranged from 10-1 μ g/L to 102 μ g/L. Average erythromycin levels were about the same across all WWTP sizes and regions. Average ibuprofen levels were significantly higher in small WWTPs than in large WWTPs ( ). Average ibuprofen levels were highest in North America -102 times higher than in Europe and 10 times higher than in Asia. With respect to WWTP operation, research findings suggest that small WWTPs should receive the same consideration as larger WWTPs where the level of treatment (i.e., degree of removal) for pharmaceuticals is concerned. Furthermore, the summarized occurrence data presented in this study provide insights to WWTP managers in assessing if enhanced WWTP treatment or downstream risks assessment for receiving streams are needed.",,,,, ,  2019 Systems and Information Engineering Design Symposium (SIEDS),Chemicals;Asia;North America;Europe;Drugs;Analysis of variance;pharmaceuticals;sewage;influent concentration;aquatic toxicity

It is one of the most used herbicides worldwide that has been already detected in soils and groundwater. Its toxicity and persistence to humans and environment have been pointed out in literature. The detection and quantification of glyphosate or its degradation product (aminomethyl)phosphonic acid (AMPA) are thus an urgent need. In this article, we use molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) integrated with different sensing platforms for glyphosate detection. The platforms are based on a piezoelectric quartz crystal and on fiber optics. The assembled piezoelectric quartz crystal system allowed to rapidly characterize MIP binding to glyphosate, with sensitivity of 0.769 and 0.496 Hz/(mg/L) and good selectivity to several tested interferents (selectivity coefficients lower than 0.04 for AMPA and inorganic salts). Optical fiber systems, namely an optical fiber tip and a dip probe fiber bundle, were further developed and combined with a fluorescent MIP selective layer, allowing a proof of concept toward an in situ operational system for glyphosate detection. Fiber tip sensor displayed higher sensitivity to glyphosate compared to dip probe, 0.19 and 0.048 (mg/L) $^{-{1}}$ , respectively, but with linear behavior in different concentration ranges, up to 1 mg/L and between 2 and 7 mg/L, respectively.

The gold electrodes on the surface of the sensor are modified by DNA probes, which can specifically combine with OTA to change the gold electrode surface structure. Consequently, when OTA was detected, the output capacitance will be changed. The results show that OTA could be effectively detected by analyzing the changes of the output capacitance of the immunosensor.

The pipeline of the development of novel drugs is quite extensive and costly apart from being complicated. On average, this entire process requires around 12 years costing approximately 2.6 billion USD. In this age of computational power, AI-based techniques are used in almost all of the steps during the process of discovering and developing drugs. AI has been able to reduce the time requirement and amount of money involved in this process thus expediting the entire procedure of new pharmaceutical inventions. In this manuscript, we have discussed some of the major applications of AI in the pharmaceutical sector. Tools that are employed to forecast the toxicity of drugs and how some of them, for example - Toxtree, ADMET, ProTox etc. have been used by researchers in the drug discovery process, have also been talked about.

In this paper, we have focused on implementing IOT in the prevention methodology of keeping people from becoming victims of falling in empty borewells, which might cause fatal injuries and subsequent death. The dawning of burgeoning industrial demand for the earth's natural resources like water, petrol, diesel and compressed natural which are available deep inside the earth's crust, require the earth's surface to be mechanically broken up and thrust into. This generates the need to delve into the earth's crust to produce deep underground hollows which can be referred to as borewells. After the exploitation of the earth's natural resources from under the ground, these borewells are often laid bare and exposed from the surface of the earth primarily due to negligence of the manufacturing industry authorities and the local government corporation maintenance services. The exposed holes on the earth's surface make people susceptible to falling into the deep wells which might cause fatal injuries or their eventual death. Even exposure to the toxicity of the earth's internal environment may cause unforeseen internal health damage. The prevention methodology provides a fully automated system that raises an alert in case of the proximity of any person with the borewell opening. We have discussed two prevention methods, one using an ultrasonic distance sensor and the other using a passive infrared sensor. The ultrasonic distance sensor uses the principle of echo with ultrasonic sound waves while the passive infrared sensor uses the change in intensity of infrared waves to determine the distance between the person and the borewell and thereby raise an alert.",,,,, ,  2023 International Conference on Next Generation Electronics (NEleX),Earth;Natural resources;Law enforcement;Infrared sensors;Acoustics;Injuries;Water resources;borewell;prevention;proximity;sensor;alert

Human lymphocytes were exposed to SPIONs at 11.2μg/ml concentrations of Fe in each group for 3 h at 37°C. Single-dose toxicity was tested in isolated lymphocytes using MTT assay. Uncoated SPIONs were found highly toxic while the coated ones showed significantly less cell death. In vitro genotoxicity of the formulated SPIONs showed significantly lower %tail DNA than uncoated SPIONs as detected by comet assay in lymphocytes. The results show that SPION induced genotoxicity is completely dependent on its physicochemical properties. Regulation of these properties by using different coatings could decrease toxicity.

Michael",,,"A Distributed, Collaborative Intelligent Agent System Approach for Proactive Postmarketing Drug Safety Surveillance",,,10.1109/TITB.2009.2037007 , ,2010,"Discovering unknown adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in postmarketing surveillance as early as possible is of great importance. The current approach to postmarketing surveillance primarily relies on spontaneous reporting. It is a passive surveillance system and limited by gross underreporting (<10% reporting rate), latency, and inconsistent reporting. We propose a novel team-based intelligent agent software system approach for proactively monitoring and detecting potential ADRs of interest using electronic patient records. We designed such a system and named it ADRMonitor. The intelligent agents, operating on computers located in different places, are capable of continuously and autonomously collaborating with each other and assisting the human users (e.g., the food and drug administration (FDA), drug safety professionals, and physicians). The agents should enhance current systems and accelerate early ADR identification. To evaluate the performance of the ADRMonitor with respect to the current spontaneous reporting approach, we conducted simulation experiments on identification of ADR signal pairs (i.e., potential links between drugs and apparent adverse reactions) under various conditions. The experiments involved over 275 000 simulated patients created on the basis of more than 1000 real patients treated by the drug cisapride that was on the market for seven years until its withdrawal by the FDA in 2000 due to serious ADRs. Healthcare professionals utilizing the spontaneous reporting approach and the ADRMonitor were separately simulated by decision-making models derived from a general cognitive decision model called fuzzy recognition-primed decision (RPD) model that we recently developed. The quantitative simulation results show that 1) the number of true ADR signal pairs detected by the ADRMonitor is 6.6 times higher than that by the spontaneous reporting strategy; 2) the ADR detection rate of the ADRMonitor agents with even moderate decision-making skills is five times higher than that of spontaneous reporting; and 3) as the number of patient cases increases, ADRs could be detected significantly earlier by the ADRMonitor.",,,,, ,  ,Collaboration;Intelligent agent;Drugs;Safety;Surveillance;Decision making;Delay;Software systems;Patient monitoring;Computerized monitoring;Adverse drug reactions (ADR);fuzzy logic;intelligent agents;postmarketing surveillance;recognition-primed decision (RPD) model

These entities utilize instrumented profiles to disseminate divisive content and disinformation, shaping public perception. Despite ample evidence of these instrumented profiles, few identification methods exist to locate them in the wild. To evade detection and appear genuine, small clusters of instrumented profiles engage in unrelated discussions, diverting attention from their true goals [34]. This strategic thematic diversity conceals their selective polarity towards certain topics and fosters public trust [49]. This study aims to characterize profiles potentially used for influence operations, termed “on-mission profiles,” relying solely on thematic content diversity within unlabeled data. Distinguishing this work is its focus on content volume and toxicity towards specific themes. Longitudinal data from 138K Twitter (rebranded as X) profiles and 293M tweets enables profiling based on theme diversity. High thematic diversity groups predominantly produce toxic content concerning specific themes, like politics, health, and news—classifying them as “on-mission” profiles. Using the identified on-mission” profiles, we design a classifier for unseen, unlabeled data. Employing a linear SVM model, we train and test it on an 80/20% split of the most diverse profiles. The classifier achieves a flawless 100% accuracy, facilitating the discovery of previously unknown “on-mission” profiles in the wild.",,,,, ,  2023 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (BigData),Support vector machines;Toxicology;Social networking (online);Instruments;Blogs;Media;Real-time systems;On-mission profile on Twitter(X);Toxicity;misbehavior;thematic diversity in online content

Most if not all of the discernibly benign tweets which seem innocuous may very well attract inflammatory posts (hate speech) from people who find them non-congenial. Therefore, building upon the aforementioned task and predicting if a tweet will incite hate speech is of critical importance. To stifle the dissemination of online hate speech is the need of the hour. Thus, there have been a handful of models for the detection of hate speech. Classical models work retrospectively by leveraging a reactive strategy – detection after the postage of hate speech, i.e., a backward trace after detection. Therefore, a benign post that may act as a surrogate to invoke toxicity in the near future, may not be flagged by the existing hate speech detection models. In this paper, we address this problem through a proactive strategy initiated to avert hate crime. We propose DRAGNET, a deep stratified learning framework which predicts the intensity of hatred that a root tweet can fetch through its subsequent replies. We extend the collection of social media discourse from our earlier work [1], comprising the entire reply chains up to $\sim$5k root tweets catalogued into four controversial topics Similar to [1], we notice a handful of cases where despite the root tweets being non-hateful, the succeeding replies inject an enormous amount of toxicity into the discussions. DRAGNET turns out to be highly effective, significantly outperforming six state-of-the-art baselines. It beats the best baseline with an increase of 9.4% in the Pearson correlation coefficient and a decrease of 19% in Root Mean Square Error. Further, DRAGNET’S deployment in Logically’s advanced AI platform designed to monitor real-world problematic and hateful narratives has improved the aggregated insights extracted for understanding their spread, influence and thereby offering actionable intelligence to counter them",,,,, ,  2021 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM),Toxicology;Social networking (online);Hate speech;Blogs;Semantics;Data mining;Artificial intelligence;Hate intensity prediction;reply chain;social media;hate speech;stratified learning

To this end, this paper presents a conductive droplet-based disposable sensor. Unlike conventional sensors, the droplet system is easily replaceable and is capable of detecting multiple vapours based on surface tension gradient. The response time for the presented sensing arrangement was found to be 3-4 seconds which is better than the solid-state counterparts. The chemiresistive sensor used in this work, is fabricated on 2.5 μm thick ultra-flexible graphene oxide-chitosan (GOC) bioresorbable substrate with Pt electrodes which are 60 μm apart. The presence of GO in the GOC substrate provides optimum hydrophobicity to the droplet for efficient operation. The electrostatic interaction and strong hydrogen bonds between GO and polysaccharide groups in chitosan provides tunable hydrophobicity and stability to the droplet. Moreover, biocompatibility, low-toxicity and bioresorbability of GOC substrate are highly desirable in the disposable sensing applications. With a conductive droplet of ~10 μL of aq.

The hospital must have a well drawn out procedure for maintenance of equipments serving as a reference for doctors, clinical laboratories and nurses with expertise and appropriate diagnosis and treatment procedures. There could be varieties of diseases in so many inpatients and outpatients that need attention. For any patient depending upon the disease by virtue of the symptoms, clinical test reports and history of the patient, a doctor with his knowledge base is to make a decision and prepare a diagnosis. Based on the diagnosis the treatment procedures are implemented by the nurses. This process is a much generalized methodology for any location wherever treatment is necessary for the patients. It is also observed that there is always a shortage of medical practitioners and expertise required for many diseases. Drug dosing is a technique that is done to cure the diseases through proper prescription and control of drugs that have been identified to the corresponding disease based on diagnosis. Drug dosing is a very critical and challenging step that needs to be correctly monitored and prescribed by the doctor. Drug dosing in human beings also depends upon size, area, weight and volume of the recipient. There are various ways of drug dosing, targeted therapies are the current state of the art and are probably the best predictor in terms of perceiving the dosing. Nanobio systems are used for targeted therapies. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recommended the use of nanobio systems for targeted therapy and drug dosing but they do not have many models.

This paper addresses a multi-task joint learning approach which combines external emotional features extracted from another corpora in dealing with the imbalanced and scarcity of labeled datasets. Our analysis are using two well-known Transformer-based models, BERT and mBERT, where the later is used to address abusive content detection in multi-lingual scenarios.

This approach increases data efficiency, reduce overfitting via shared representations, and ensure fast learning by leveraging auxiliary information. Our findings demonstrate that emotional knowledge helps to more reliably identify hate speech and offensive language across datasets.

In this work we have proposed a unique design of an automated droplet detection analyzer to be coupled with the targeted biochip for providing detailed analysis result based on the data acquired through optical detection. This newly proposed design not only enables the detection analysis of samples based on predefined characterized results - but also enhances the process of integration of multiple biochips to perform different set of test sequences on different biochips on the basis of these analysis results obtained in the proposed analyzer. The architecture, synthesis and simulation of the proposed droplet analyzer for signals obtained from Blood oxygen analysis, each for multiple samples in a single biochip has been displayed in this paper - and the results are found to be quite encouraging.",,,,, ,  2012 IEEE 55th International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems (MWSCAS),Microfluidics;Biomedical optical imaging;Optical sensors;Computer architecture;Blood;Electrodes;Microprocessors;Droplet detection;Digital analyzer;Photosensors;Digital microfluidics;Biochips

There are several unique optical properties that can make nano rods (NRs) potentially more appealing bioimaging probes. Hydrophobic core-shell-shell CdSe/CdS/ZnS nano rods (NRs) were synthesized by successive ion layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) technique. Synthesized NRs (CdSe/CdS/ZnS) were made water dispersible by ligand exchange with thioglycolic acid and were conjugated with folic acid (FA) using EDC/NHS techniques for targeting human cancer cells expressing folate receptor (FR). The Folate receptor (FR) is ideally suited for this study because it is preferentially expressed with high binding affinity for folic acid in several cancers. In vitro cytotoxicity of the folate-conjugated CdSe/CdS-TGA and CdSe/CdS/ZnS-TGA NRs were investigated also by employing MCF-7 cells (Breast cancer cell line) through the 3-(4,5- dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. This assay shows that core-shell-shell (CdSe/CdS/ZnS) NRs are biocompatible than core- shell (CdSe/CdS) for targeting the cancer cells. The result of MTT viability assay shows that the percentage of living cells gradually decreases for CdSe/CdS rods where as in case of CdSe/CdS/ZnS rods ≥ 80% percentage of cell viability has been observed. These experiments confirms that FA conjugated NRs are preferentially internalized by MCF-7 tumor cells suggesting their potential utility as targeted fluorescent imaging agent for early stage cancer detection. The MTT cell viability assay indicated that covering the CdSe/CdS rods with ZnS shell reduces their cell toxicity.",,,,, ,  International Conference on Advanced Nanomaterials & Emerging Engineering Technologies,Nanobioscience;Probes;Quantum dots;Heating;Core-shell-shell;Nano rods;Thioglycolic acid;Folic acid

Conventional techniques used for the detection of CWAs are complex, expensive and require sophisticated analytical procedures thus entailing the development of alternative analytical tools. Biosensors offer an alternative analytical approach with a promise of selectivity in addition to sensitivity, ease of use, rapid response and negligible sample pre-treatment. Furthermore, biomolecules have the ability to detect toxicity in addition to concentration. This work reports the development of a fluorescence based biosensor for detection of SM. 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (2-CEES), a sulfur mustard mimic which is structurally similar to it but not as lethal was used for the study, utilizing the ability of chlorophyll to detect the said compound owing to fluorescence. For this, chlorophyll extract from a plant source was immobilized on fibre glass discs of 5mm diameter, and its fluorescence was studied by excitation at 437 nm and emission at 667 nm. The exposure of the biocomponent to 2-CEES led to quenching of fluorescence, which varied linearly with increasing concentration of 2-CEES with a detection limit of 7.68 × 10−10 M. The fluorescence drop mechanism was characterized by HPLC studies which confirmed the conversion of chlorophyll, upon exposure to the analyte, to non-fluorescing catabolic products.

Its embryos are used extensively in biology and medicine to perform chemical screens to identify drug candidates or to evaluate teratogenicity and embryotoxicity of substances. Behavioral readouts are increasingly used to assess the effects of compounds on the nervous system. Early stage zebrafish show characteristic behavioral features at stages between 30 and 42 hours post fertilization (hpf) when exposed to a short and bright light flash. This so-called Photomotor Response (PMR) is a reaction of the nervous system of the fish and can be used as a marker in screenings for neuroactive chemicals. To probe a broad and diverse chemical space, many different substances have to be tested and repeated observations are necessary to warrant statistical significance of the results. Although PMR-based chemical screens must use a large number of specimens, there is no sophisticated, automated high-throughput platform available which ensures minimal human intervention. Here we report a PMR platform that was developed by combining an improved automatic sample handling with a remotely controllable microscope setup and an image analysis pipeline. Using infrared illumination during automatic sample preparation, we were able to eliminate excess amounts of visible light that could potentially alter the response results. A remotely controlled microscope setup allows us to screen entire 96-well microtiter plates without human presence that could disturb the embryos. The development of custom video analysis software, including single egg detection, enables us to detect variance among treated specimens and extract easy to interpret numerical values representing the PMR motion.

N-acetylcysteine (NAC) commonly known as acetylcysteine, is a pharmaceutical drug and nutritional supplement with numerous uses. Its primary use is as a mucolytic agent. The drug rapidly metabolizes to intracellular glutathione which acts as a powerful antioxidant in the body. Finally, it has been claimed to have a protective effect against cancer for its action as an antioxidant and a glutathione precursor. Acetaminaphen (AC) is widely used as an analgesic anti-pyretic drug with similar effects as aspirin. It is regarded as a suitable replacement for aspirin in patients sensitive to aspirin or those with asthma. Intravenous acetylcysteine is typically administered for the treatment of paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose. Large quantities of paracetamol causes a minor metabolite called N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI) that accumulates in the body and is normally conjugated by glutathione. When taken in excess, the body's limited glutathione reserves fail to inactivate the toxic NAPQI. The metabolite thus produced is then free to react with key hepatic enzymes, damaging hepatocytes. This may lead to severe liver damage and even to death by fulminant liver failure. Due to this fatal effect, simultaneous determination of these compounds (NAC & AC) is very important. However, a major problem is that at bare electrodes, the anodic peak potentials for NAC and AC are almost the same, which results in their overlapped current responses and makes their discrimination very difficult. In this project, a new dopamine-derivative, i.e. N-(3,4-dihydroxyphenethyl)-3,5dinitrobenzamide (N-DHPB), was synthesized and its application was investigated for the simultaneous determination of NAC and acetaminophen (AC) using modified multiwall carbon nanotubes paste electrode. This modified electrode exhibited a potent and persistent electron mediating behavior followed by well separated oxidation peaks of NAC and AC. Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) peak currents of NAC and AC increased linearly with their concentration in the ranges of 0.5-200 μmol L-1 and 15.0-270 μmol L-1 respectively. The detection limits for NAC and AC were 0.2 μmol L-1 and 10.0 μmol L-1 respectively. The relative standard deviation for seven successive assays of 1.0 and 30.0 μmol L-1 NAC and AC were 1.7% and 2.2%, respectively. The proposed sensor was successfully applied for the determination of NAC in human urine, tablet, and serum samples.",,,,, ,  2010 International Conference on Enabling Science and Nanotechnology (ESciNano),Carbon nanotubes

Furthermore, a heterojunction of CsAg2I3/GaN was fabricated and employed in the self-powered ultraviolet (UV) photodetectors (PDs) by capitalizing on its excellent band matching and wide bandgap. The presence of a built-in electric field in the heterojunction significantly suppresses the dark current, which results in a remarkably high photo-to-dark current ratio (PDCR) of approximately 3700. The low dark current additionally contributes to the reduction of shot noise, thereby enabling the detectivity of the device to reach $10^{{12}}$ Jones.

In this regard, point-of-care testing (POCT) shows several advantages, enabling simple and rapid analyses, real-time results, and home-testing [1]. Metallic nanoparticles (NPs), like gold NPs (AuNPs), can be beneficially integrated into POC devices thanks to their tunable plasmonic properties, which provide naked-eye readout [2]. Moreover, the high sensitivity enabled by NPs allows the detection of biomarkers in non-invasive fluids where the concentrations are typically low. These biofluids, like saliva and urine, are functionally equivalent to serum in reflecting the physiological state of the body, whilst they are easier to handle, collect, and store [3]. In this work, we first reported the design and development of a colorimetric strategy based on the morphological change of multibranched plasmonic AuNPs, aimed at detecting glucose in saliva [4]. The sensing approach relied on a target-induced reshaping process, which involves the oxidation of the NP tips and the particle transformation into a spherical shape, characterized by a naked-eye detectable blue-to-pink color change. The platform proved to be beneficial in the early and non-invasive diagnosis of hyperglycemia. The successful technological transfer on a solid substrate paved the way for the realization of a dipstick prototype for home-testing. Then, the strategy was adapted to other biomarkers, leading to the development of a multiplexing test for the simultaneous detection of three salivary analytes (cholesterol, glucose, and lactate) [5]. This multiplexing assay enabled saving reagents, costs, and time, while increasing the overall clinical value of the test. Exploiting the microfluidics applied on a paper sheet, we realized a monolithic and fully integrated POC device, through a low-cost and fast $CO_{2}$ laser cutter. The platform showed excellent selectivity and multiplexing ability, with negligible interferences. The second part of this work was focused on the development of POC devices for the detection of anticancer drug contaminations in water solutions and urine samples. Antiblastic agents have revealed high toxicity for the exposed healthcare workers who prepare and administer these drugs in occupational environments [6]. Hence, continuous monitoring is highly required, and POCT shows tremendous potential in this context. With this aim, we realized a lateral-flow device (LFD) for the assessment of doxorubicin contaminations, using the fluorescent properties of the drug for naked-eye detection [7]. The pharmacological recognition of the dsDNA probe was exploited to overcome the lack of anti-doxorubicin antibodies. The highly sensitive strategy was successfully adapted to a real urine sample, without resorting to complex pretreatment procedures. Then, we developed a competitive LFD device for the detection of methotrexate (MTX). AuNPs were employed as the label molecules and the pharmacological competition of folic acid and MTX for the capture enzyme was used as the recognition mechanism, instead of costly antibodies. Despite the sensitivity requires further improvements, the strategy showed fast and reliable results, demonstrating a high potential for workers’ safety monitoring.",,,,, ,  2023 IEEE Nanotechnology Materials and Devices Conference (NMDC),Drugs;Multiplexing;Sensitivity;Point of care;Biomarkers;Antibodies;Plasmons;point-of-care testing;early diagnostics;naked-eye;multiplexing;lateral-flow devices;anticancer drugs

To assess combined drug action, the classical methods such as isobologram and interaction index are still simple and sometimes unable to describe complex drug interaction adequately. Statistical-model based methods are found more flexible and informative in detecting and characterizing complex drug interactions, which require well- designed experiments. In this study, a kind of experimental designs, called mixture designs, is proposed for the detection and characterization of multi-drug synergism and optimization. Compared with other statistical-model based methods, mixture designs are demonstrated to be more useful when the total dose of the drugs under investigation is to be controlled in a moderate level. A case study of inhibition effect of three bioactive chemical compounds identified from an anti-angiogenesis traditional Chinese medicine on human umbilical vein endothelial cells is shown as an illustration to demonstrate the application of mixture designs in multi-drug combination discovery.",,,,, ,  2007 1st International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering,Drugs;Design for experiments;Design optimization;Design methodology;Chemical compounds;Humans;Veins;Bioinformatics;Design automation;Statistical analysis

Therefore, developing an accurate cisplatin detection method is valuable for personalized treatment planning. In this study, we developed a novel p-amino thiophene (PATP) reaction-mediated surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) assay for cisplatin detection.

Eighteen Tibet minipigs were caged in aseptic rooms and randomly divided into six groups. Five groups (n = 3/group) were irradiated with single doses of 2, 5, 8, 11 and 14 Gy of total body irradiation (TBI) using an 8-MV X-ray linear accelerator. These pigs were evaluated with [18F]-FDG-PET/CT, and their marrow nucleated cells were counted. The data were initially collected at 6, 24 and 72 h after treatment and were then collected on Days 5–60 post-TBI at 5-day intervals. At 24 and 72 h post-TBI, marrow standardized uptake value (SUV) data showed a dose-dependent decrease in the radiation dose range from 2–8 Gy. Upon long-term observation, SUV and marrow nucleated cell number in the 11-Gy and 14-Gy groups showed a continuous and marked reduction throughout the entire time course, while Kaplan–Meier curves of survival showed low survival. In contrast, the SUVs in the 2-, 5- and 8-Gy groups showed early transient increases followed by a decline from approximately 72 h through Days 5–15 and then normalized or maintained low levels through the endpoint; marrow nucleated cell number and survival curves showed approximately the same trend and higher survival, respectively.

Since its treatment dosage is very close to its toxic dosage, poisoning frequently take place due to misuse, brucine and its derivatives are the principal component responsible for its pharmacodynamic effect and toxicity, strychnine is main component responsible for its toxicity. Both strychnine and brucine are typical antagonists of the glycine receptors on postsynatic membrane. Its toxic effects are mainly to cause central excitation. Because of its strong toxicity, narrow safety range and cumulative effect, the use of the drug in the clinical practice tends to cause poisoning, and poisoning of the drug is associated with the large dosage, and/or the long time use. Its toxicity also varies with its origins of production or batches. The symptoms of strychnos nuxvomica poisoning vary. The autopsy findings mainly include pathological changes caused by acute disorder of blood circulation, characterized by the congestion and edema of organs or pinpoint bleeding of mucosa or serous membrane. Long-term toxicity test revealed no characteristic pathological changes of vital organs in animals. For the detection of poisonous substances, the stomach tissue or stomach contents are the best choices, and urine, intestinal contents are the next best materials. Liver, brain and spinal medulla also have high level of strychnos nuxvomica after poisioning.

Si-based MOSFETs (planar or nanowire) have the great advantage of compatibility to the current microelectronic manufacturing processes, but suffer from current drift due to ion diffusion into the gate oxide layer, making them difficult to detect target analytes at low concentrations in physiological buffers or fluids with high ionic strengths. III-nitride semiconductors have attracted considerable interests for biosensor applications due to their unique properties, such as chemical inertness, non-toxicity, and thermal stability. Especially, III-nitrides FETs are ion-impermeable and highly stable in electrolytic solutions, making them ideal for detection at ultralow concentration in fluids with high ionic strengths. Theoretical calculations suggest that nanowire and quantum dot FETs should have higher sensitivity than planar FETs due to the large surface to volume ratio.

We propose a novel data mining approach to signaling potential ADRs from electronic health databases. More specifically, we introduce potential causal association rules (PCARs) to represent the potential causal relationship between a drug and ICD-9 (CDC. (2010). International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9). [Online]. Available: http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd/icd9.html) coded signs or symptoms representing potential ADRs. Due to the infrequent nature of ADRs, the existing frequency-based data mining methods cannot effectively discover PCARs. We introduce a new interestingness measure, potential causal leverage, to quantify the degree of association of a PCAR. This measure is based on the computational, experience-based fuzzy recognition-primed decision (RPD) model that we developed previously (Y. Ji, R. M. Massanari, J. Ager, J. Yen, R. E. Miller, and H. Ying, “A fuzzy logic-based computational recognition-primed decision model,” Inf. Sci., vol. 177, pp. 4338-4353, 2007) on the basis of the well-known, psychology-originated qualitative RPD model (G. A. Klein, “A recognition-primed decision making model of rapid decision making,” in Decision Making in Action: Models and Methods, 1993, pp. 138-147). The potential causal leverage assesses the strength of the association of a drug-symptom pair given a collection of patient cases. To test our data mining approach, we retrieved electronic medical data for 16 206 patients treated by one or more than eight drugs of our interest at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Detroit between 2007 and 2009. We selected enalapril as the target drug for this ADR signal generation study. We used our algorithm to preliminarily evaluate the associations between enalapril and all the ICD-9 codes associated with it. The experimental results indicate that our approach has a potential to better signal potential ADRs than risk ratio and leverage, two traditional frequency-based measures. Among the top 50 signal pairs (i.e., enalapril versus symptoms) ranked by the potential causal-leverage measure, the physicians on the project determined that eight of them probably represent true causal associations.",,,,, ,  ,Drugs;Association rules;Electric potential;Frequency measurement;Databases;Computational modeling;Adverse drug reactions (ADRs);data mining;fuzzy logic;postmarketing surveillance;potential causal association rules (PCARs);recognition-primed decision model (RPD)

The complexes of lead are very stable within the body and cannot be metabolized or degraded rapidly, leading to lead toxicity. Therefore, it is important to detect low levels of lead in the environment to prevent lead poisoning in humans. The detection of Pb2+ ions at the nanomolar and micromolar level is achieved using DNA aptamers and quantum dots. Pb2+ ions can be detected using a DNA aptamer known as thrombin binding aptamer (TBA), which folds into a G-quadruplex structure when lead is present. The conjugation of a quantum dot and a gold nanoparticle (AuNP) to the TBA allows for optical detection via fluorescence resonant energy transfer. In the aptamer probe discussed herein, the excited quantum dot fluoresces when the DNA is in a random coil configuration. Once the Pb2+ ion-induced folding occurs, the fluorescence is reduced through energy transfer to the AuNP. The quenching efficiency observed with the liquid assay probe and the filter paper probe at 1-ţM Pb2+ ions is 41% and 71%, respectively.",,,,, ,  ,Ions;Probes;Fluorescence;Optical filters;DNA;Particle beam optics;Quantum dots;DNA;gold nanoparticle (AuNP);quantum dot (QD);thrombin binding aptamer (TBA)

However, it becomes a little hard for them to deal with the responsibility, i.e., to regulate and filter the toxic or harmful content across the platform, specifically in filtering out the offensive comments posted by the users. In this work, we are particularly interested in the main mission of hate comment detection. Our major objective is to flag those comments which are offensive, harmful, and abusive in an online conversation. This paper proposes an original ensembling based learning scheme, taking the power of LSTM neural networks, to solve this crucial problem. LSTMs, specially designed types of RNNs, have shown to be effective in sequence modeling and also demonstrated some promising results in problems related to sequences. Our methodology is based on the existence of certain LSTM models of small size, which are trained on an independent fraction of all completed and pre-processed data. This approach allows the ensemble to capture the diversity in patterns; hence, it contributes to the large robustness of hate comment detection. In an ever-globalized and digitized world, the advent of dependable methodologies for hate comment detection becomes cardinal in acquiring safe and inclusive online environments.

This paper proposes a defense method that integrates model interpretability techniques, combining gradient-based and perturbation-based approaches. The method generates image heat maps and filters perturbed images to construct an effective data cleaning framework for identifying and removing backdoor triggers. Experiments on the Traffic Sign Recognition Dataset show that this integrated approach maintains high detection accuracy across various attack modes, achieving a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.975 under random triggers.

However, the implementation of FL faces many challenges, as achieving a balance between data privacy, model security, and system efficiency is difficult, often requiring the sacrifice of efficiency for privacy and security. Moreover, this process typically assumes the existence of a trusted server for coordination. Addressing these challenges, this article proposes a privacy-preserved and efficient FL framework with blockchain (PEFL). PEFL utilizes blockchain and differential privacy techniques to coordinate privacy protection among clients, and filters out anomalous model parameters through an aggregation-side detection algorithm to resist poisoning attacks. Under the assumption of an untrusted server, we design the model-validated fault-tolerant federation (MFF) consensus mechanism based on a committee, balancing efficiency expectations to regulate the server and ensure the reliability of the training process. Through experiments on the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets, and comparison with typical FL schemes, PEFL demonstrates better defense against various attack models.

The presence of agrochemicals in the air is caused by drift—a phenomenon that originates from ground and aerial spraying applied in lands used for agribusiness. Drift refers to the spread and wind-driven transport of agrochemicals that have been volatilized during spraying, and which can easily reach towns and cities. Actively monitoring agrochemical drift is essential to protect the health of citizens and the environment. Many of the systems used for monitoring agrochemicals are currently analog, while those with some degree of digitalization are expensive, complex, and not easily scalable. Therefore, new cost-effective, stand-alone, reliable, easy-to-implement, and citizen-oriented technological tools need to be designed and developed. This article introduces “DriftGLY,” an innovative, low-cost Internet of Things (IoT) early warning system that utilizes a digital traffic light to continuously and automatically monitor the presence of agrochemicals in the air, both individually and in cocktail form. The key innovation of DriftGLY lies in the close relationship between the configuration of its digital traffic light and the precise calculation of the quantity of agrochemicals deposited in spray tanks. This configuration is specifically based on the parameter of the dose rate expressed in liters per hectare of these contaminants. DriftGLY incorporates an original collection system that allows for the indirect detection of agrochemicals in their particulate, gaseous, and, unlike traditional systems, liquid forms. In this manner, DriftGLY displays pollution risk levels through its digital traffic light, transmitting them to an IoT platform via various connectivity options, such as WiFi, LoRaWAN, and GSM/GPRS, and posts them on the social network X (formerly known as Twitter). The aim of this action is to democratize information and promote the necessary changes for citizens to enjoy a healthy and balanced environment.",,,,, ,  ,Agrochemicals;Monitoring;Pollution measurement;Internet of Things;Contamination;Wireless fidelity;Technological innovation;Agriculture;agrochemicals;air pollution;environmental monitoring;Internet of Things (IoT);low-power wide-area network (LPWAN);persistent organic pollutants (POPs);smart cities

Some of them such as SF2, S2F2, SF4, SOF2, SOF4 are easy to take hydrolysis and alkaline reactions, and some such as SO2F2, are able to occur partially alkaline reactions, and some are almost impossible to decompose such as S2F10, S2F10O and so on. The total amount of low-fluoride sulfide which can undergo hydrolysis and alkaline reactions in SF6 could be determined by hydrolysis fluoride. Therefore, if the content of hydrolyzable fluoride is found to be significantly higher than its initial value, some internal faults may exist in the equipment. In addition, hydrolyzable fluoride in SF6 will lead to the corrosion and accelerate deterioration of equipment and solid insulation materials. The amount of hydrolyzable fluoride represents the degree of toxicity, which is one of the important indicators of the quality control of SF6. In this paper, the amount of hydrolyzable fluoride in SF6 is determined by the ion chromatography. The variation tendencies of hydrolyzable fluoride are investigated under discharge and overheating conditions and the content of hydrolyzable fluoride in SF6 in normal and failure conditions is compared. In this paper, the traditional method is improved by simplifying the absorption method of the lye absorption step and adopting mechanical oscillation absorption, which make the absorption effect is controllable, the automatic drawing by the ion chromatography workstation in the standard working curve drawing step, which makes the operation easier.

Dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is the traditional method and gold standard for evaluating ablation treatment region. But it has the disadvantages of slow imaging and the inability to perform multiple examinations due to the toxicity of the Gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA). After analyzing the similarity and consistency of DCE and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) ablation treatment regions, the segmentation algorithm of the high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation region based on DWI and deep learning is developed to ensure the real-time, effectiveness and safety of ablation region monitoring. Twenty female patients with histologically confirmed uterine fibroids were selected to undergo MRgFUS treatment along with DWI and DCE examination. An end-to-end multimodal image segmentation network DWIseg-net was constructed to segment the ablation regions in DWI, and performed 5-fold cross validation, using non perfusion volume (NPV) in DCE as the gold standard. The proposed DWIseg network directly detects the ablation treatment region on intraoperative DWI, resulting in a DSC of 0.8845, which is superior to previous methods. The ablation treatment rate detected by DWIseg net showed no statistically significant difference compared to the standard NPV ($p=0.3883$).

Advances in microfluidics technology offer exciting possibilities in the realm of enzymatic analysis, DNA analysis, proteomic analysis involving proteins and peptides, immuno-assays, and environmental toxicity monitoring. Another emerging application area for microfluidics-based biochips is clinical diagnostics, especially the immediate point-of-care diagnosis of diseases. As the use of microfluidics-based biochips increases, their complexity is expected to become significant due to the need for multiple and concurrent assays on the chip. There is a need to deliver the same level of computer-aided design (CAD) support to the biochip designer that the semiconductor industry now takes for granted. These CAD tools allow designers to harness the new technology that is rapidly emerging for integrated biofluidics. This paper presents early work on CAD tools that allow biochip users to describe bioassays at a sufficiently high level of abstraction. It describes synthesis tools that can map behavioral descriptions to a droplet-based microfluidic biochip and generate an optimized schedule of bioassay operations, the binding of assay operations to functional units, and the layout and droplet flow-paths for the biochip. Cost-effective testing techniques are presented to detect faults after manufacture and during field operation. It is shown how on-line and off-line reconfiguration techniques can be used to easily bypass faults once they are detected.

This paper show how SciDB's multi-dimensional arrays and in-situ distributed array processing enable pharmaceutical, medical, and materials science research that uses imaging mass spectrometry (MS), a new technology for quantifying and visualizing the spatial distribution of molecules by their molecular masses. Materials scientists use imaging mass spec to understand the interactions of substrates and coatings using various delivery methods such as sputtering and masking. Drug developers use imaging mass spec to determine where in the tissues and cells of an organ a drug compound is distributed. Drug developers can also look for indications of toxicity and efficacy by observing the redistribution of naturally occurring molecules such as lipids. The principle use of imaging mass spectrometry is to test for differences between drug candidate molecules before they are tested in humans and to explain toxicity that is observed in humans. As the use of MS scales from small experiments to automated workflows involving typical studies of animal subjects treated with different drugs, dosages, and methods of administration over longitudinal time periods, there is a critical need for software like SciDB to handle organizing and signal processing the 100s of TBs of data generated so that scientists get timely results.",,,,, ,  2017 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data),Arrays;Imaging;Drugs;Program processors;Instruments;Servers;Compounds;array database management system;heterogeneous data;mass spec imaging;SciDB

Lead and its derivatives exhibit a high level of toxicity, capable of inducing various ailments. Nevertheless, existing lead detection systems are suffered from several drawbacks, including sluggish response times, elevated cost, and a lack of mobility. Here, a sensor for highly sensitive, selective, and rapid detection of the trace amount of toxic lead (Pb $^{{2}+}{)}$ ions was successfully developed using tungsten disulfide (WS $_{{2}}{)}$ functionalized interdigitated electrodes (IDEs). Pristine and silver (Ag)-loaded WS2 were synthesized via the facile hydrothermal method. A series of characterizations are performed to investigate the crystal structure, surface morphology, and elemental composition of the synthesized materials. When exposed to 10 parts per billion (ppb) of Pb $^{{2}+}$ ion solution, pristine WS2 nanorods exhibited a 1.31-mA change in current, while at the loading of 1% and 2% Ag, further enhancements in Pb $^{{2}+}$ ion sensitivity were observed. However, further increasing the Ag (4 wt%) loading on WS2 nanorods reduced the sensing response. The developed sensor was characterized by an excellent sensitivity of $819 \mu \text{A}$ /ppb and an impressive detection limit of 75 ppt. Additionally, the sensor showed a rapid response time of less than 5 s, rendering its suitability for real-time heavy metal ion detection applications. The outstanding performance of WS2-based sensors makes them a compelling choice for practical application in monitoring environmental quality and detecting toxic metals.",,,,, ,  ,Ions;Nanorods;Water pollution;Metals;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Thermal engineering;Sensitivity analysis;Tungsten;Hydrothermal;lead (Pb2+);selectivity;sensitivity;silver (Ag) loading;tungsten disulfide (WS2)

In order to determine wide chain length PFCAs simultaneously, weak anion exchange (WAX) cartridges have recently been used for solid phase extraction (SPE) in analysis of these chemicals in environmental water samples. However, given the conflicts between the limited ion-exchange capacity of WAX cartridges and the relatively large enrichment coefficient required for analysis of these low pollution level chemicals, it is crucial to select appropriate water sample volumes for specific WAX cartridges in order to ensure the recoveries for all analytes. The objective of this study is to determine the breakthrough volumes of short- and long-chain PFCAs in analysis of sewage using specific WAX cartridges (60 mg, 3 cc) for SPE. The results indicate that the occurrence of breakthrough is dependent on not only the sample volume but also the perfluorocarbon chain length of analytes. The breakthrough volumes for short-chain PFCAs (<C5) range from 200 to 300 mL, while breakthrough does not happen on the medial- (C5-C10) and long-chain ones (>C10) in present study. The relatively low recoveries of long- chain PFCAs (>C10) are mainly due to matrix effects rather than breakthrough because internal standard is not suitable for these chemical. Finally, the volume selected for loading on WAX cartridges (60 mg, 3 cc) in analysis of sewage is 200 mL in order to avoid breakthrough for short-chain PFCAs (<C5) and reduce matrix effect as far as possible for long-chain ones (>C10). Meanwhile, this volume also ensures the quantitation of these chemicals presented in sewage samples because enrichment coefficients are large enough.",,,,, ,  2009 3rd International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering,Chemical analysis;Solids;Water pollution;Chemical industry;Toxicology;Chaos;Pollution control;Educational institutions;Pollution measurement;Interference

The threat of chemical and biological attack is becoming increasingly more likely. Since the liver metabolizes xenobiotic species, construction of a liver tissue based biosensor allows the detection of a wide range of harmful agents by detecting physiological changes in cultured liver cells. Previously, the development of such technology has been limited since traditional 2D culturing methods lead to dedifferentiation and loss of hepatic functions within hours to days. By recreating a 3D culture environment similar to the acinus in the liver, maintenance of differentiated hepatic functions such as albumin secretion, urea synthesis and cytochrome p450 1A1 production has been demonstrated for culture periods over 14 days. Measurement of cytochrome p450 1A1 through ethoxyresorufin dealkylation (EROD) was adapted for use as a diagnostic to optically assess toxicity of probe compounds. Detection by both spectroscopy and 2-photon microscopy was developed to allow temporal as well morphological exploration of toxicity. These methods were used to successfully detect both aflatoxin B1, and microcystin LR. For microcystin, a five fold decrease in EROD intensity was observed within 12 hours.

To address the challenge of tracking irregular moving targets, we first extend the space for detection and trajectory matching by adding buffers to compensate for the bias of Kalman filtering in motion estimation. However, improperly setting the buffer size may lead to the problem of misassociation of different targets. To cope with this problem, we propose a new association strategy. Specifically, we classify trajectories into high-density region trajectories and low-density region trajectories by Gaussian density estimation and perform the association in two steps. In the first step of association, we match the high-density region trajectories with the detection using a smaller buffer Intersection over Union that is adaptively adjusted; while in the second step of association, we match the remaining trajectories with the detection using a larger buffer Intersection over Union that is adaptively adjusted. Although, our method is relatively simple, it works well in the multi-target tracking task of phytoplankton. We validated this paper's method using Peridinium umbonatum var. inaequale as an experimental subject, and the experimental results show that the evaluation metrics of IDF1, IDSW, HOTA, and MOTA of multi-target tracking reach 83.91, 317, 76.93, and 92.87, respectively, with an accuracy that is significantly better than that of existing multi-target tracking methods.

It is thus essential to consider realistic in-body limitations for direct drug targeting applications. Here, we present a novel controller for microrobot maneuver by considering four key in vivo constraints: non-Euclidean structure of capillaries, irreversibility of blood flow, invisibility of microvasculature, and inaccuracy of microrobot tracking. We use the taxicab geometry of capillaries as the a priori knowledge for steering and tracking a microrobot in lattice-like vessels. Furthermore, we introduce a minimax repulsive boundary function to prevent the microrobot from getting too close to the boundaries imposed by the direction of blood flow. We also propose a novel Kalman filtering algorithm to reduce tracking error, while avoiding possible obstacles such as vessel walls without knowing their actual locations.

In particular, the demand for real-time monitoring of hydrogen fluoride (HF) increases continuously due to its high toxicity, contrary to its wide use in industries. In addition, compact size and low cost are favorable to utilize the sensor in wide spreading applications in industries. Here, we present a compact HF gas sensor with high sensitivity and selectivity. The HF sensors, fabricated in the form of field-effect transistors (FETs) using a cost-effective and mass-production friendly conventional semiconductor process, are shown to possess good electrical characteristics enabled by a silicon nanosheet (SiNS) current channel. High sensitivity on gas phase HF is achieved by the unique catalytic sensing membrane—platinum/polycrystalline lanthanum fluoride (Pt/poly-LaF3). The high responsivity ( ${S}_{{\textit {R}}}{)}$ of 3071% at 25 ppm and the low limit of detection (LOD) of 219 ppb were achieved at room temperature (RT), along with a quick response time of 5.56 min, which are crucial for the workplace environmental safety.

The diseased oil palm plants normally shows a range of symptoms such as coloured spots or streaks that will occur on the leaves, stems, and seeds of the plant. At present, in the agricultural sectors, diagnosing the type disease of plants are based on human expert, which is alongside with the conventional method applied using test device and performing laboratory test. Therefore, the needs in new approach to classify type of diseases are preferable. Hence, the aim of this paper is to focus on an innovative method based on image processing technique for classifying the lack of nutritional disease occurred in oil palm leaves by analyzing the leave surface only. The result is usable as a guide for fertilization since the trees respond rapidly to the applied fertilizers. The main important concern is to ensure the sufficient amount of fertilizer since excessive intake of fertilizers will cause toxicity to trees and indirectly increase cost of fertilizers. Images of oil palm leaves will be captured using high-end digital imaging device to analyse the leaves surface. Further, feature extraction algorithms also will develop based on shape, texture, and colour of the disease type. The feature vectors will be attained acting as inputs to fuzzy classifier.

A key metric of EHT phenotype is the contractile (twitch) force with which the tissue spontaneously beats. It is well-known that cardiac muscle contractility – its ability to do mechanical work – depends on tissue prestrain (preload) and external resistance (afterload). Objectives: Here, we demonstrate a technique to control afterload while monitoring contractile force exerted by EHTs. Methods: We developed an apparatus that can regulate EHT boundary conditions using real-time feedback control. The system is comprised of a pair of piezoelectric actuators that can strain the scaffold and a microscope that can measure EHT force and length. Closed loop control allows dynamic regulation of effective EHT boundary stiffness. Results: When controlled to switch instantaneously from auxotonic to isometric boundary conditions, EHT twitch force immediately doubled. Changes in EHT twitch force as a function of effective boundary stiffness were characterized and compared to twitch force in auxotonic conditions. Conclusion: EHT contractility can be regulated dynamically through feedback control of effective boundary stiffness. Significance: The capacity to alter the mechanical boundary conditions of an engineered tissue dynamically offers a new way to probe tissue mechanics. This could be used to mimic afterload changes that occur naturally in disease, or to improve mechanical techniques for EHT maturation.",,,,, ,  ,Force;Actuators;Dynamics;Microscopy;Image edge detection;Force measurement;Monitoring;Biomedical imaging;cardiomyocyte;contractility;force control;tissue engineering

The two algae were cultivated in three concentrations of 50, 100 and 500 μg L-1 for 72 h; and the temporal production of malondialdehyde (MDA) and the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) were determined. Results showed that MDA responded quicker than SOD in P. tricornutum and S. costatum, a peak of MDA was detected after 2 h of exposure, while the activity of SOD peaked after 12 h of exposure. For studying the growth behavior of diatoms in the bi-algal culture to POPs, two species in different initial cell densities were investigated in 28-day exposure to the three POPs in concentrations of 15 and 50 μg L-1. The growth of P. tricornutum increased significantly only in the medium enriched with 50 μg L-1 DDT (ratiomax = 148%). On contrast, the cell density of S. costatum increased during the most time of exposure regardless of initial cell density. The results demonstrate that POPs toxicity could cause oxidative stress even cell damage in both P. tricornutum and S. costatum, but algal growth was promoted by the POPs in the mixed culture, which indicated that the presence of pollutants in the sea was an important inducement of the species groups change. The results of this study may provide valuable help for detailed studies of oxidative stress and growth behavior responses of marine diatom to POPs.",,,,, ,  2010 International Conference on Multimedia Technology,Algae;Stress;Proteins;Communities;Tides;Compounds

Biases of manual moderation can thwart the efforts taken to prevent the presence of hate speech on online platforms. However, posts that convey important meanings also fall prey to such systems, which should be avoided. Such systems fail to educate their authors what should have been done differently.

The platform can be more sustainable and cost efficient, if they were to discard redundancies of which major portion is constituted by the spam comments or comments that are offensive/abusive. In this paper several machine learning models are used in order to reduce those comments and eventually towards a more efficient storage model. We first address the task of dataset preparation by designing a comprehensive annotation scheme, considering various dimensions such as sentiment, topic, toxicity, and engagement. Leveraging this annotated dataset, we develop a robust machine learning framework that combines state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques with advanced classification algorithms. Our methodology involves several stages, including preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training.

Specific contrast image sequences have been developed to take advantage of the specific microbubble ultrasonic properties. USCAs are well tolerated and do not exhibit allergic reactions or renal toxicity. USCAs increase the Doppler signal intensity from vessels of deep location, small caliber, or in case of reduced and/or slow blood flow. They improve the detection of vessels with limited access due to anatomic limitations. Under certain circumstances they can alter the texture to provide tissue perfusion information.

Consequently, high-quality imaging slices can be reconstructed directly from the SDCM stacks with a single scan. The image quality achievable with this SRRF-Deep method is comparable with the SRRF method, whereas it achieves image reconstruction about 30 times faster using 100 times fewer images.

In this paper, we propose an automatic classification of dendritic cells that could serve as a second non-subjective opinion for pathologists.

Then, a set of features such as shape descriptors are extracted for cell characterization. At this step, three cell classes are distinctively identified by experts. Nevertheless, a high ambiguity is revealed between cell classes. Possibility theory can offer a realistic framework for making reliable decisions under high ambiguity. It exploits a human natural concept of the implicit use of probability distribution for deciding on the possibility of some assertions in some contexts where a cognitive conflict is observed while interfering existing related postulates, leading to high ambiguity.

Coastal shellfish aquaculture sites are subject to seasonal blooms of toxic microalgae, which may result in restrictions on shellfish harvest due to human health risk. In southeastern Nova Scotia, such toxic episodes are uncommon, although significant numbers of putatively toxigenic phytoplankton are often found in the water column. In most coastal regions where diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) incidents have occurred, the events have been associated with blooms of species of the planktonic dinoflagellate Dinophysis. However, despite repeated attempts over several years, the authors have been unable to link the presence of DSP toxicity in Nova Scotian shellfish to the timing and magnitude of seasonal blooms of Dinophysis spp., even using sophisticated analytical techniques for toxin detection in size-fractionated planktonic material. Accordingly, the authors are now focusing on the epibenthic/epiphytic microalgal community associated with the suspended culture of bivalve shellfish in Mahone Bay, N.S., specifically blue mussels (Mytilus edulis). Loosely aggregated material (termed ""slub"") on shellfish lines was found to contain low levels of DSP toxins. Significant numbers of cells of a toxigenic epibenthic dinoflagellate, Prorocentrum lima were associated with the epiphytic macroalga Pilayella littoralis, a common fouling organism on suspended shellfish lines. Unialgal isolates of P. lima from this material were confirmed to produce DSP toxins in culture. Spirolides, a new class of biologically-active marine compounds, have also been identified within the digestive tissues of blue mussels and sea scallops from the east coast of Nova Scotia, including sites in Mahone Bay. The spatio-temporal distribution and seasonal occurrence (typically early May to July) of spirolides in shellfish strongly suggested a planktonic origin, and these compounds have been traced to specific size-fractions (predominately 20-50 /spl mu/m) of plankton from the upper water column. An unusual group of pigmented spherical cells (""golden balls""), with taxonomic affinities to certain gonyaulacoid dinoflagellates, are dominant in these fractions. To establish the role of attached and suspended particulate material surrounding shellfish aquaculture installations on phycotoxin transfer and feeding mechanisms, data were collected on standard oceanographic parameters (chlorophyll, inorganic nutrients, seston, POM/PIM, plankton composition and abundance, water column stratification). Preliminary studies with a high-resolution underwater photo-imaging system provided an extended time-series (48 h) of the vertical distribution of attached and suspended particulates (""marine snow""). The particle field immediately adjacent to the shellfish lines was clearly distinct from that of a nearby control site (30 m distant) and the phytoplankton composition was unrepresentative. This indicates a potentially serious bias in the application of conventional techniques for water column monitoring of toxigenic phytoplankton in nearshore coastal zones.",,,,, ,  Oceans '97.

The results demonstrate high fluorescence response and changes, fast kinetics 1.5±0.3 ms, and enhanced amplitude of fluorescence response, even if the voltage sensor is not completely repolarized. The results bring verification of advantageous properties of ASAP1 and confirm a big potential of modern voltage sensitive dyes and their application in neural activity sensing where these properties play an important role.

With the advancement of technology, this study focuses on providing a review of current trends and challenges related to aquatic biomonitoring. In particular, the advancements made in the designs of biosensors and Biological Early Warning Systems (BEWS) were presented. This includes biosensors that utilize luminescent bacteria, algae, living and/or microbial fuel cells. For BEWS, those that use fishes, daphnids, and bivalves as sentinel organisms were discussed. It was shown that biosensors and BEWS show promising potential for monitoring water quality of aquatic ecosystems as they allow for real-time monitoring while performing comparably to traditional analytical methods. Despite the various research done, there are still some issues and challenges concerning aquatic biomonitoring. BEWS and biosensors were shown to have their advantages and disadvantages. Biosensors can quantify the tested parameters but are analyte-specific and often need to be replaced upon detection. On the other hand, BEWS allow for continuous real-time monitoring but are often site-specific and require an established baseline data of the water quality parameters. To combat the issues, this study proposes designing a BEWS using bivalves for early detection and utilizing analytical methods to confirm changes in water quality. It is also recommended that further research be done to determine levels of toxicity, capacity to meet needs, and water quality baseline data for local aquatic ecosystems.",,,,, ,"  2022 IEEE 14th International Conference on Humanoid, Nanotechnology, Information Technology, Communication and Control, Environment, and Management (HNICEM)",Microorganisms;Ecosystems;Fuel cells;Algae;Water quality;Market research;Real-time systems;aquatic biomonitoring;biosensor;early warning;water quality

It is one of the main reasons that cause incineration power plants to have a “Not in my back yard”. At present, the long-period, high-cost offline detection method used in industrial sites cannot achieve real-time monitoring of DXN emission concentration. Moreover, the number of samples used to build a DXN emission concentration prediction model is extremely scarce. Aim at the above problems, a method for predicting DXN emission concentration in MSWI process based on PSO and equispaced interpolation is proposed. At first, the domain of original small sample input and output is expanded based on the improved mega-trend-diffusion(MTD) technology. Then, the equal interval interpolation method is used to generate the virtual sample inputs, which are used to obtain the virtual sample outputs by combining the mapping model. The above results are combined with the expansion space to delete the bad virtual samples. Thirdly, the PSO algorithm is used to optimize and select the reduced virtual sample set. Finally, a mixed sample set composed of the optimized selected virtual sample set and the original small sample set is used to construct a DXN emission concentration prediction model.

The existing treatment for GBM, which involves a combination of resection, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, has a very limited success rate with a median survival rate of <;1 year. This is mainly because of the failure of early detection and effective treatment. We designed a novel 3-D GBM cell culture model based on microwells that could mimic in vitro environment and help to bypass the lack of suitable animal models for preclinical toxicity tests. Microwells were fabricated from simple and inexpensive polyethylene glycol material for the control of in vitro 3-D culture. We applied the 3-D micropatterning system to GBM (U-87) cells using the photolithography technique to control the cell spheroids' shape, size, and thickness. Our preliminary results suggested that uniform GBM spheroids can be formed in 3-D, and the size of these GBM spheroids depends on the size of microwells. The viability of the spheroids generated in this manner was quantitatively evaluated using live/dead assay and shown to improve over 21 days. We believe that in vitro 3-D cell culture model could help to reduce the time of the preclinical brain tumor growth studies.

Furthermore, we propose a generic model evolution framework, named M-Evolve, which combines graph augmentation, data filtration and model retraining to optimize pre-trained graph classifiers.

Due to its discrete nature droplets can be manipulated through multiple reconfigurable paths derived by preprogrammed electrode actuation sequences through this planar array known as digital microfluidic biochip system. Cross contamination between heterogeneous samples turns out to be a major issue concerned with transportation of droplets and correctness of the detection results for the bioassay protocols -which is highly significant for clinical diagnostics and toxicity monitoring applications. In this paper we have proposed an intelligent route path exploration technique that attempts partially or completely to avoid the number of cross contamination depending on the fluidic constraints employed during routing. The path is further refined using intelligent detour by identifying zones of friction between two adjacent route paths that optimizes the overall route time by reducing the overall time for stalling while routing -as well as further optimization of resources to be utilized. The simulation is carried out on test benches of benchmark suite I and benchmark suite III. The results show improvement in overall as well as average route time and major reduction in the number of crossovers.,,,,, ,  2013 8th International Conference on Design & Technology of Integrated Systems in Nanoscale Era (DTIS),Decision support systems;Nanoscale devices;Diffusion tensor imaging;Routing;Contamination;Mixers;Layout;digital microfluidics;Cross contamination;routing;detour;algorithm;resource utilization

Early detection, identification and preparation of appropriate response strategies is especially important in the case of semi-enclosed Basins like the Southern Baltic Sea, mainly due to the marine ecosystems' continuous absorption of pollutants including oil, heavy metals and chemicals. Many of those agents are characterised by great toxicity and cause devastation of the natural environment. The recent development in the information technology provides the means and possibilities for much faster and more efficient access to survey data, allowing their remote, nearly real-time management, processing and visualisation. Several approaches and techniques of measurements are available in marine environment monitoring. These consist of direct sampling, airborne and satellite imagery, hydrological measurements using CTD probes, remote sensing with the use of electromagnetic waves, acoustic methods based on the data acquired by multi-beam and side-scan sonars and single-beam echosounders. The acquisition, processing, integration and visualisation of various kinds of data constitutes an important problem in the context of development of applications supporting littoral environment management. These methods are not easily suited for monitoring threat levels for maritime Critical Infrastructures (CI) like ports and shipyards. However, this field has also been explored, using specialised modules like CARVER2trade or similar systems now easily available not only commercially. The presented system integrates data from all of the aforementioned sources as well as others, like live radar feed and oil spill spread simulation results. The data from the investigated marine region is presented in the form of multiple, time-varying layers, rendered in up to three dimensions. The system allows authenticated end users to remotely view these layers in a geographic context while also providing interactive features like oil spill spread animation and tools for layer query. The CI threat sensing element of the system is being developed in cooperation with the City of Gdansk. The system's application for monitoring water pollution as well as processing, integration and visualsation of various kinds of background and sensor data has been reported recently. The presented system consists of several modules, or subsystems, namely the Data Integration and Adaptation module, the Remotely Accessible GIS and third-party simulation engines, connected through the interface for Simulation Modules. The Data Integration and Adaptation module is developed using the Microsoft .NETplatform and the ESRI ArcGIS Engine, which is a set of GIS objects with application programming interfaces (APIs) for COM, .NET, Java, and C++. To provide a common and efficient solution for geospatial data serving via the TCP/IP protocol, the system utilises the ArcSDE application server that facilitates storing and managing spatial data (raster, vector, and survey) in an underlying database. ArcGIS Engine MapControl and GlobeControl components provide a standard set of GIS functionalities like map viewing, zooming and panning for twodimensional and three-dimensional imaging respectively. Interfaces to various external sensors were implemented during the development of the system. The Web-GIS module was developed entirely with the use of Open-Source technology. It utilizes the established GeoServer technology for serving Open Geospatial Consortium's (OGC) standard Web Map Service (WMS) layers and Apache Web Server as the HTTP proxy. Data processing is done by means of custom Java 2 Platform Standard Edition servlets running within the Tomcat Servlet Engine. The browser-independent DHTMI client is built with help of the Openlayers Javascript library. The Interface for Simulation Modules allows third-party applications to provide data directly into the Spatial data Management and Analysis element of the system. This allows for producing semi-dynamic thematic layers from otherwise incompatible data. Third-party modules, currently plugged into the system, consist of the CAROCS system oil spill spread simulation data and NI2 developed CARVER2 analysis tool for comparing dissimilar types of Critical Infrastructure using the same standards, which allows for quick and easy identification and comparison of their vulnerabilities at the local, state and national levels in order to assist government officials in the allocation of protective resources.",,,,, ,  OCEANS 2009-EUROPE,Geographic Information Systems;Surveillance;Engines;Petroleum;Hydrologic measurements;Remote monitoring;Java;Pollution;Data visualization;Acoustic measurements

Exposure to these toxic gases can be through inhalation of mists, fumes, aerosols, and dust. These inhaled gases can cause injuries, including skin burns, respiratory distress, and death. Nowadays, these harmful toxic agents have become more common in domestic environments, increasing the chances of toxic inhalation in daily life. In a domestic environment, gas toxicity is detected through the odor of toxic gases, as equipment for gas sensing is not readily available and expensive, requiring technical expertise for usage. This situation demands novel methods for avoiding toxic inhalation injuries. Furthermore, most toxic gases affect the breathing rate; thus, constant detection of breathing rate may provide an early warning for toxic gas inhalation and avoid injury. This research study develops a software-defined radio (SDR) system using radio frequency (RF) sensing to monitor abnormal breathing rates continuously by observing channel state information (CSI) variations in the domestic environment. This research work can effectively detect abnormal breathing rates for multi-person in the same environment. The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) frequency domain analysis-based method is used to detect the abnormal breathing rates of multiple individuals.

The method of drug repurposing can be employed to address this issue, which recognizes new applications of existing drugs outside of their original intended purpose. This paper utilizes a novel complex multi-layered network (MLN) approach for aggregating drug networks of varying information into a single unified network. Under the hypothesis that drugs that are closely related will appear as neighboring nodes, using a community detection approach allows novel discovery of new applications of old and existing drugs. This paper describes a method to aggregate MLNs. Drug data is collated from DrugBank and PubChem; an adjacency matrix is created, from which the Normalized Graph Laplacian (NGL) is generated. Prior to network aggregation, eigenvectors, and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) methods were utilized to reduce the network dimension. Additionally, a nonparametric inference was implemented to test for complete spatial randomness (CSR) to check for node scattering.

This review digs into the most recent breakthroughs in coal-based CD production and uses, with a particular emphasis on their potential for energy, environmental protection, biomedicine, and polymer composites. Coal-based CDs provide several advantages, including minimal toxicity, excellent biocompatibility, high chemical stability, and outstanding photophysical characteristics. As a result, they have been extensively explored in biological imaging, ion detection, photocatalysis, and optoelectronic devices. Researchers were able to precisely control the optical properties of CDs by regulating band gaps and introducing heteroatom (N, P, S, and B) doping, taking advantage of the quantum confinement effect and edge effect. Furthermore, the scalability of coal-based CDs holds the promise of widespread applications and the commercialization of environmentally friendly and cost-effective nanomaterials, which will benefit a variety of fields and improve people's quality of life. Despite significant progress, several knowledge gaps remain, demanding further research. These include understanding the structure-property relationship, developing eco-friendly synthetic approaches with improved yield and quantum yield, and exploring the potential of coal-based CDs in diverse application domains.

Toxic sewage discharged from textile industries contains azo dyes. They affect soil fertility, water resources, marine organisms and the ecosystem. Benzedine is responsible for skin irritation and also increases the toxicity in blood and bone marrow which affects the production of blood cells and hence leads to anemia. Exposure to these benzedine dyes can induce hemolytic anemia which leads to deformation of Red Blood Cells (RBCs). In this work, an automated detection of toxicity is proposed to alert the workers prior to the critical stages of cancer. The proposed system consists of a portable unit where the blood samples are analyzed and the toxic status of the dye factory workers can be transmitted from the local health centre to the nearby hospital. Microscopic images of the smeared blood samples are acquired using the digital microscope. These RBC images of normal and abnormal are segmented using Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) segmentation.

This study aims to develop a simple testing system of toxicity of the indoor particulate matter by detecting bioluminescence reduction of marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri. Suspended particulate matter in indoor and outdoor air was collected on a quartz fiber filter at a flow rate of 23.5 L/min. by a low volume air sampler for 7-day duration, at the terrace and living room of an apartment house in Kanagawa, Japan. Collected materials were extracted with sterilized distilled water by mild shaking. After filtration with 0.45 mum pore size filter, the extracts were subsequently mixed with a bacterium solution in a well of 24-well plate and time courses of bioluminescence intensity were measured by a luminometer. As a result, the water extracts of indoor and outdoor aerosol samples significantly reduced the bioluminescence of Vibrio fischeri and the inhibition per sampling volume increased with increasing TSP concentrations. The inhibition per unit mass of the indoor aerosols became greater than that of outdoor aerosols, when increasing in air change rate. The inhibition tended to correlate with nitrate and sulfate concentrations in the extracts.

Toxic comments not only contribute to a negative user experience but also have the potential to propagate hate speech, harassment, and cyberbullies. Therefore, there is a pressing need for robust and efficient comment toxicity detection systems that can automatically identify and flag toxic comments. The proposed methodology involves preprocessing the data-set by removing punctuation, applying stemming and lemmatization techniques to standardize the text. The data is then transformed into a matrix representation using tokenization, padding, and word embedding techniques. In the word embedding phase, three popular algorithms, namely Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText, are compared to determine the most suitable approach for capturing the semantic meaning of words. The architectural design comprises several layers, encompassing an embedding layer, bidirectional LSTM layer, dropout layers, and dense layers. The bidirectional LSTM layer plays a crucial role in assimilating contextual information from both preceding and subsequent words within the comment. Training involves utilizing the training set, followed by evaluation. This project addresses the crucial need for comment toxicity detection and provides an effective methodology for identifying toxic comments in online platforms.

A computer-aided system that can detect automatically the nerve region would facilitate the anesthetist's daily routine and allow them to concentrate more on the anesthetic delivery. In this paper, we propose a new method based on merging deep learning models from different data to detect the median nerve. The merged architecture consists of two branches, one being one-dimensional (1D) convolutional neural networks (CNN) branch and another 2D CNN branch. The merged architecture aims to learn the high-level features from 1D handcrafted noise-robust features and 2D ultrasound images. The obtained results show the validity and high accuracy of the proposed approach and its robustness.",,,,, ,  2020 25th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR),Visualization;Ultrasonic imaging;Merging;Surgery;Computer architecture;Anesthesia;Robustness

There are reportedly 588 registered poultry farms and approximately 175 meat processors throughout the country. Water should be free from any diseases that can affect the health of poultry. The United Nations pointed out that water is necessary, and a sufficient supply (adequate, secure, and accessible) must be available to everyone. Since then, the Philippine poultry industry is continuously growing, but the water management system is not improving, so the farmers encountered the same problem for their broilers. One of the best applications to prevent the problem in water management is through the laboratory that takes time to get the results about the toxicities of water. Because there are no existing devices or machines identifying the toxicity of water for the broiler industry. Therefore, a device was created to deploy it to the poultry farms toward their water supply, particularly the broiler animals' water intake. It detects water toxicity utilizing four (4) features, including pH Level for water detection in terms of alkalinity or acidity, total dissolved solids for all organic and inorganic substances, etc. Experimental results show its reliability through multiple testing of the poultry farm water comparing it to the expensive and manual laboratory tests.

A non-negligible factor is the abnormal time-dependent cellular response curves (TCRCs) of the wells located at the edge of the E-plate which is defined as edge effect. In this paper, a novel statistical analysis is proposed to detect the edge effect. First, TCRCs are considered as observations of a random variable in a functional space. Then, functional principal component analysis (FPCA) is adopted to extract the principal component (PC) functions of the TCRCs, and the first and second PCs of these curves are selected to distinguish abnormal TCRCs. The average TCRC of the inner wells with the same culture environment is set as the standard. If the distance between the scoring point of the standard curve and one designated scoring point exceeds the defined threshold, the corresponding TCRC of the designated point should be removed automatically.

However, fishes are also easily perishable, especially when it gets stuck in traffic, further increasing the rate of decomposition of the fish as it is transported from the fish port to the local markets across the nation. There are several methods of preservation like icing, but there are also widespread reports regarding the adulteration of Formalin to the fish not only during transport but also its use in the wet markets nationwide to keep fish and other perishable products fresh. Formalin is used to increase the shelf life of fish to a certain extent, but its use provides a health risk to the consumer because it is a known carcinogenic chemical compound and can be toxic when consumed even on a very small amount approximately 0.00002% of the consumers weight. This paper is a study that used an electronic nose system in the detection of formalin specifically on fish samples.

Satellites can also more persistently monitor for HABs. In the past, empirical methods and machine learning methods have used multispectral satellite imagery to estimate HAB biomass. To build upon the current body of research, this paper investigates an approach to expedite HAB detection by utilizing a convolutional neural network (CNN) deployed onboard a CubeSat in low Earth orbit to detect HABs in near-real-time.

The presented method consists of two parts: adaptive coordinate transformation and curve evolution for edge detection. In the first part, the impact of refraction is taken into consideration. An adaptive calibration method is developed, which enables the coordinate transformation matrix to adapt to the changing water depth. In the second part, the abovementioned calibration result is used to keep the injection pipette tip descending along the desired route. A curve-evolution-based edge detection algorithm is introduced to detect the deformation of larva skin caused by contact with the injection pipette tip. Experimental results demonstrate that high accuracy and success rates are achieved. The effect of uncertainties caused by water-depth variation and the skill requirement in manual manipulation are eliminated. The proposed contact detection strategy can be extended to microinjection for other organisms. Note to Practitioners—As a typical multicellular model organism, the zebrafish has been increasingly used in biological research. For studying drug toxicity and disease models, exogenous substances need to be injected into zebrafish larvae. However, for both manual and automated injection, a fatal problem is that the camera on the microscope only provides 2-D positional information. It is laborious to align the pipette tip with the injection site along the $z$ -axis. Moreover, due to the characteristic of stereomicroscopes, the impact of refraction at the water surface cannot be ignored. In order to address these issues, in this article, we present an adaptive calibration method and an edge detection algorithm for zebrafish larva heart injection to avoid contact failure in practical implementations.",,,,, ,  ,Microinjection;Heart;Image edge detection;Calibration;Cameras;Active contours;Coordinate transformation;curve evolution;edge detection;microinjection;zebrafish larva

This pesticide can invade living cells of the human body through contact or ingestion. We report an electrochemical sensor based on a layer by layer deposition of PDAC/GO on silver electrodes. The sensor fabrication, physical characterization i.e. Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy of PDAC/GO based films, and its electrochemical characterization are discussed. The detection of DMT by analyzing electrochemical measurements including cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy shows that functionalization using layer by layer deposition improves electrochemical response and presents a basis for detection of DMT. The highest response is observed in the case of only one PDAC/GO layer which is attributed to the properly balanced interaction between DMT and PDAC/GO layer, and the increase of electrical resistivity of the PDAC/GO layer with its thickness.",,,,, ,"  2019 16th International Multi-Conference on Systems, Signals & Devices (SSD)",Electrodes;Silver;Graphene;Electric potential;Oxidation;Scanning electron microscopy;Insects;Pesticide detection;electrochemical sensor;cyclic voltammetry;impedance spectroscopy;graphene oxide

Traditional biosensors are based on the unique specificity of enzymes to their substrates, antibodies to antigens or that of nucleic acids to their complementary sequences. In recent years we have promoted the use of a different concept, that of whole cell biosensors. An intact live cell, containing a selected gene promoter fused to a reporter gene, serves both as the sensing and the reporting element; the specificity of the system is controlled by the choice of promoter. Using this approach we have constructed microbial sensing systems for the environmental detection of toxicants, genotoxicants, oxidants, and specific groups of halogenated organics, as well as cyanobacterial sensors of nutrients bioavailability. In order to turn these cells into a ""real"" biosensors, they need to be immobilized onto a solid platform and coupled into the signal transduction apparatus.

They tend to stimulate and paralyze nerve system of the body and cause other toxic side effects. Once these toxic chemicals are released into the atmosphere, timely detection and identification of the same at standoff distances will help the defensive forces to take proper counter measures. Detection techniques such as ion mobility spectrometry, infrared spectrometry, Raman spectrometry, FTIR, LIDAR, etc. have been used widely. Among all these techniques, Raman spectroscopy techniques and LIDAR (LIght Detection and Ranging) is the only active remote detection method that can detect and discriminate the chemical agents at standoff distances. Infrared DIAL (Differential Absorption Lidar) is a versatile technique for remote detection of various chemicals. DIAL technique can provide spatially resolved measurements of these agents with sufficient sensitivity (at few ppm levels) at ranges of several kilometers by exploiting the concept such as scattering and absorption from the atmosphere. The main objective of this review paper is to bring out the details of highly potential chemical warfare agents, their properties and laser based remote detection sensors.

However, in an edge computing deployment one cannot assume that resource-constrained end devices are sufficiently secure. In other words, we have to consider the possibility of these devices being compromised and can be abused to facilitate poisoning attacks. Privacy-preserving is another important property to consider when dealing with sensitive user data on end devices. Most existing approaches only consider either defending against poisoning attacks or supporting privacy, but not both properties simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a differentially private federated learning model against poisoning attacks, designed for edge computing deployment. First, we design a weight-based algorithm to perform anomaly detection on the parameters uploaded by end devices in edge nodes, which improves detection rate using only small-size validation datasets and minimizes the communication cost. Then, differential privacy technology is leveraged to protect the privacy of both data and model in an edge computing setting. We also evaluate the detection performance in the presence of random and customized malicious end devices, and compare its performance with those of two other competing approaches published in IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing, in terms of attack resiliency, and communication and computation costs.

The most dose-limiting factor in radiotherapy is the radiation-induced lung toxicity (RILT). RILT is generally measured semi-quantitatively, by a dyspnea, or shortness-of-breath, score. In general, about 20-30% of patients develop RILT several months after treatment, and in about 70% of the patients the delivered dose is insufficient to control the tumor growth. Ideally, if the RILT score would be known in advance, then the dose treatment plan for the low-toxicity-risk patients could be adjusted so that higher dose is delivered to the tumor to better control it. A number of possible predictors of RILT have been proposed in the literature, including dose-related and clinical/demographic patient characteristics available prior to radiotherapy. In addition, the use of imaging features -- which are noninvasive in nature - has been gaining momentum. Thus, anatomic as well as functional/metabolic information from CT and PET scanner images respectively are used in daily clinical practice, which provide further information about the status of a patient. In this study we assessed whether machine learning techniques can successfully be applied to predict post-radiation lung damage, proxied by dyspnea score, based on clinical, dose-related (dosimetric) and image features.

Several machine-learning binary classifiers were applied to discriminate the two groups.

TOP can automatically learn a mixed molecular representation from not only SMILES contextual information that describes the molecule structure, but also physiochemical properties. Therefore, TOP can overcome the drawbacks of existing methods that use either of them, thus greatly promotes toxicity prediction.

For nonlinear regression, the kernel function of SVM transforms the nonlinear input space into a high dimensional feature space in which the solution of the problem can be represented as being a linear regression problem. Therefore, in all probability the performance of SVM models is decided by the kernel function, and choosing a proper kernel function is very important. Whereas the nature of the data is usually unknown, it is very difficult to make, on beforehand, a proper choice out of the possible kernel functions. For this reason, during the model building process, usually more than one kernel is applied to select the one which gives the best prediction performance. Unfortunately, this will lead to a very time-consuming optimization procedure. To circumvent this disadvantage, a novel universal kernel function based on the Pearson VII function (PUKF) is introduced in this paper. PUKF can replace the common kernel functions, and simplifies the training process of SVM nonlinear regression.

An ECG dataset that contained recordings from patients under control and sotalol condition was analyzed. In order to relate sotalol-induced ECG changes to its effect on ion channel level, i.e., blockade of the rapid component of the delayed rectifier potassium channel (IKr), varied degrees of IKr blockade were simulated in a slab of ventricular tissue. The mean JT area increased by 36.5% following the administration of sotalol in patients. Simulations in the slab tissue showed that sotalol increased action potential duration preferentially in the midmyocardium, which led to increased transmural dispersion of repolarization and JT area.

Facilitated by this technology advance, a framework named integrated testing strategies (ITS) has been proposed in the predictive toxicology domain, in an effort to intelligently jointly use multiple heterogeneous toxicity data records (through data fusion, grouping, interpolation/extrapolation etc.) for toxicity assessment. This will ultimately contribute to accelerating the development cycle of chemical products, reducing animal use, and decreasing development costs. Most of the current study in ITS is based on a group of consensus processes, termed weight of evidence (WoE), which quantitatively integrate all the relevant data instances towards the same endpoint into an integrated decision supported by data quality. Several WoE implementations for the particular case of toxicity data fusion have been presented in the literature, which are collectively studied in this paper. Noting that these uncertainty handling methodologies are usually not simply developed from conventional probability theory due to the unavailability of big datasets, this paper first investigates the mathematical foundations of these approaches. Then, the investigated data integration models are applied to a representative case in the predictive toxicology domain, with the experimental results compared and analysed.",,,,, ,  2014 14th UK Workshop on Computational Intelligence (UKCI),Reliability;Mathematical model;Data integration;Bayes methods;Equations;Uncertainty

This study utilized text mining methods such as LDA topic modeling and toxicity analysis to assess the prominent narratives disseminated by influential far-right accounts on three social media platforms around the riot timeframe. We utilized a novel categorization system to classify topic streams into narrative frames. Parler posts contained the greatest conspiratorial content and cross-platform content sharing. Twitter was found to have a small number of far-right accounts that actively disseminate extremist views. YouTube far-right influencers produced the highest number of videos related to racial topics. Parler posts demonstrated a strong association between toxicity measures and current trending topics. A few mentions of far-right accounts within the top 20 topic streams, reveal that extreme racial and nationalist ideologies are active on the Twitter platform, even though overall toxicity was low. Our YouTube data was seeded by far-right accounts, and therefore, not surprisingly, the content was revealed to contain a high degree of racially-charged discourse. Our analysis revealed, however, that the YouTube data was also characterized by a high level of toxicity coming from both creators and commenters. Both Parler and YouTube demonstrated that some far-right content creators were able to drive up the toxicity of the discourse. These results attest to the impact social media influencers have on online discourse. Interestingly, however, the toxicity scores for related YouTube videos remained low, suggesting that the video-promotion algorithm does not necessarily increase exposure to radical content.",,,,, ,  2024 International Conference on Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing (CLNLP),Text mining;Toxicology;Video on demand;Social networking (online);Blogs;Drives;Natural language processing;Web sites;Streams;Videos;text mining;social media;domestic extremism

This study aims to develop an automated tool that can assist clinicians in localizing and segmenting the median nerve from the wrist, mid-forearm, and elbow in ultrasound videos. This is the first fully automated single deep learning model for accurate segmentation of the median nerve from the wrist to the elbow in ultrasound videos, along with the computation of the cross-sectional area (CSA) of the nerve. The visual transformer architecture, which was originally proposed to detect and classify 41 classes in YouTube videos, was modified to predict the median nerve in every frame of ultrasound videos. This is achieved by modifying the bounding box sequence matching block of the visual transformer. The median nerve segmentation is a binary class prediction, and the entire bipartite matching sequence is eliminated, enabling a direct comparison of the prediction with expert annotation in a frame-by-frame fashion. Model training, validation, and testing were performed on a dataset comprising ultrasound videos collected from 100 subjects, which were partitioned into 80, ten, and ten subjects, respectively. The proposed model was compared with U-Net, U-Net++, Siam U-Net, Attention U-Net, LSTM U-Net, and Trans U-Net. The proposed transformer-based model effectively leveraged the temporal and spatial information present in ultrasound video frames and efficiently segmented the median nerve with an average dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of approximately 94% at the wrist and 84% in the entire forearm region.",,,,, ,  ,Transformers;Videos;Ultrasonic imaging;Image segmentation;Wrist;Task analysis;Visualization;Cross-sectional area (CSA);median nerve segmentation;ultrasound video;vision transformer (ViT)

Despite their prevalence, the deployment of these models within IoT systems introduces distinctive security vulnerabilities. In particular, adversaries may execute model poisoning attacks, which aim to alter the decision-making processes of embedded models, leading to erroneous outcomes. Existing model poisoning attacks necessitate access to extensive auxiliary datasets, such as the training dataset itself or one with same distribution. These requirements often render such attacks impractical in IoT contexts, given the constrained storage and computational resources of IoT devices. This paper proposes the first model poisoning attack against interpreters without auxiliary datasets to manipulate the model’s behavior. We evaluate the attack on three real-world datasets, and results indicate that this attack can successfully coerce the targeted interpreters to produce outcomes aligned with an adversary’s intentions, while maintaining nearly indistinguishable performance from the original model, thereby ensuring its stealthiness. Furthermore, beyond directly affected interpreters, our experiments reveal that four additional interpreters coupled to the poisoned model are indirectly influenced, underscoring the attack’s transferability.",,,,, ,  ,Computational modeling;Data models;Internet of Things;Training;Predictive models;Neural networks;Monitoring;Mobile computing;Dogs;Biomedical monitoring;Interpreter;IoT devices;model poisoning attack;neural networks

As expected 2DE-based estimates significantly underestimated 3DE-based estimates. Intra-observer and inter-observer variability using both analysis packages showed a huge variability, due to significant differences in end systolic volume and EF.

The RADEval tool, designed to process large scale datasets, imported a total of 2,760 segmentation datasets, along with a Simultaneous Truth and Performance Level Estimation (STAPLE) to act as ground truth tumor segmentations. Virtual dose-maps were created within RADEval and two different tumor control probability (TCP) values using a Logistic and a Poisson TCP models were calculated in RADEval using each STAPLE and each dose-map. RADEval also virtually generated a ring of normal tissue. To evaluate clinical impact, two different uncomplicated TCP (UTCP) values were calculated in RADEval by using two TCP-NTCP correlation parameters (δ = 0 and 1). NTCP values showed that semi-automatic segmentation resulted in lower NTCP with an average 1.5 - 1.6 % regardless of STAPLE design. This was true even though each normal tissue was created from each STAPLE (p <; 0.00001). TCP and UTCP presented no statistically significant differences (p ≥ 0.1884). The intra-operator standard deviations (SDs) for TCP, NTCP and UTCP were significantly lower for the semi-automatic segmentation method regardless of STAPLE design (p <; 0.0331). Both intra-and inter-operator SDs of TCP, NTCP and UTCP were significantly lower for semi-automatic segmentation for the STAPLE 1 design (p <;0.0331).

Focusing each round of training and prediction on target organisms and specific organ systems sufficiently narrows down the parameters for us to do useful toxicity prediction. We represent the molecules in the dataset two ways. Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry Specification (SMILES) are input to the NGN while Feature vectors (or chemical descriptors) are input to the ANN. We perform training and testing on a regression-type problem wherein we predict the Lethal Dose for 50% (LD50) of the population of a given organism for the molecules in each dataset. The results of the experiment indicates that the SMILES-NGN method outperformed the ANN method in QSAR. The SMILES-NGN estimates were closer to their targets for 87% of the trials on randomized training data (as described in Section II.B) and 62% on grouped data when compared to ANN. The results also showed less variance in 87% of cases for NGN-SMILES estimates compared to ANN.

However, for a molecule to be considered a viable drug candidate, it must exhibit certain desirable properties such as low toxicity, high druggability, and synthesizability. To address this, we propose an approach that incorporates prior knowledge about these properties during the model training process. In this study, we utilized the PubChem database, which contains 100 million molecules, to filter drug-like molecules based on the quantity of drug-likeliness (QED) score and the Pfizer rule. We then used this filtered dataset of drug-like molecules to train both molecular representation (ChemBERTa) and molecular generation models (MolGPT). To assess the performance of the molecular representation model, we fine-tuned the results on the MoleculeNet benchmark datasets. Meanwhile, we evaluated the performance of the molecular generation model based on the generated samples comprising 10,000 molecules. Despite the limited diversity of the pre-training dataset, the models for molecular representation were able to retain at least 90% of their original performance on benchmark datasets, with an additional improvement of 6% in predicting clinical toxicology. In the domain of molecular generation, the model pre-trained on drug-like molecules exhibited a high rate of desirable molecule properties in the unconditionally generated outputs. Additionally, the diversity of generated structures demonstrated notable performance compared to the conditional generation approach. Moreover, the drug-like molecule pre-training strategy is not limited to a specific model or training method, making it a flexible approach that can be easily modified based on the research interests and criteria of interest.",,,,, ,  ,Artificial intelligence;Companies;Transformers;Benchmark testing;Drug delivery;Databases;Toxicology;AI-based drug discovery;pre-training;quantity of drug-likeliness;Pfizer rule

The quality of these algorithms depends on the nature of data sets and the accuracy needed by the application. The applications of clustering algorithms in the drug discovery process are compound selection, virtual library generation, High-Throughput Screening (HTS), Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) analysis and Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Elimination and Toxicity (ADMET) prediction. Based on Structure-Activity Relationship (SAR) model, compounds with similar structure have similar biological activities. So, clustering algorithms must group more similar compounds in one cluster. K-Means, bisecting K-Means and Ward clustering algorithms are the most popular clustering algorithms that have a wide range of applications in chemoinformatics. In this paper, a comparative study between these algorithms is presented. These algorithms are applied over homogeneous and heterogeneous chemical data sets. The results are compared to determine which algorithms are more suitable depending on the nature of data sets, computation time and accuracy of produced clusters. Accuracy is evaluated using standard deviation metric. Experimental results show that K-Means algorithm is preferable for small number of clusters for homogeneous and heterogeneous data sets in terms of time and standard deviation. Bisecting K-Means and Ward algorithms are preferable for large number of clusters for homogeneous and heterogeneous data sets in term of standard deviation, but bisecting K-Means algorithm is preferable in term of time.",,,,, ,  2014 9th International Conference on Informatics and Systems,Drug Discovery;Chemoinformatics;Clustering;K-Means;Bisecting K-Means;Ward

So far, many studies have focused on reproductive toxicity on glyphosate which may trigger epigenetic changes through endocrine-mediated mechanisms. Generally, it is critical to identify the glyphosate poisoning status in order to minimize health risks. This paper proposed a machine learning approach using 110 rats' samples to identify the glyphosate poisoning status. All rats were randomly divided into 2 groups (n = 55 each) in the study. The rats in the blank control group were given 0.9% sodium chloride solution orally for 15 days, while the other groups were administered orally at the dosage of 0.5g/kg of glyphosate once per day for 15 days consecutively. Consequently, the potential of an enhanced fuzzy k nearest neighbor approach was explored through blood routine test to recognize the glyphosate poisoning condition based on the blood indices. A real-life data set was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of classification accuracy (ACC), sensitivity, specificity, and Matthews Correlation Coefficients (MCC). The results demonstrated that there were significant differences in blood routine test indices between the control and the glyphosate groups (p-value <; 0.01). It was observed in the feature selection that the most important correlated indices were white blood cell , lymphocyte , intermediate cell, and neutrophil granulocyte. A comparative study with support vector machine and artificial neural networks had shown that the proposed approach could achieve much more promising results with 95.45% ACC, 0.90 MCC, 98.89% sensitivity, and 88.89% specificity. The empirical analysis verifies that the proposed method is promising to act as a new, accurate method for identification of the glyphosate poisoning status in subjects.",,,,, ,  ,Rats;Blood;Liver;Artificial neural networks;Sensitivity;Feature extraction;Machine learning;fuzzy k nearest neighbor;feature selection;glyphosate poisoning status identification
"Mishra, Meenakshi, Huan, Jun",,,Multitask Learning with Feature Selection for Groups of Related Tasks,,,10.1109/ICDM.2013.151 , ,2013,"Multitask learning has been thoroughly proven to improve the generalization performance given a set of related tasks. Most multitask learning algorithm assume that all tasks are related. However, if all the tasks are not related, negative transfer of information occurs amongst the tasks, and the performance of traditional multitask learning algorithm worsens. Thus, we design an algorithm that simultaneously groups the related tasks and trains only the related task together. There are different approaches to train the related tasks in multi-task learning based on which information is shared across the tasks. These approaches either assume that the parameters of each of the tasks are situated close together, or assume that there is a common underlying latent space in the features of the tasks that is related. Most multi-task learning algorithm use either regularization method or matrix-variate priors. In our algorithm, the related tasks are tied together by a set of common features selected by each tasks. Thus, to train the related tasks together, we use spike and slab prior to select a common set of features for the related tasks, and a mixture of gaussians prior to select the set of related tasks. For validation, the developed algorithm is tested on toxicity prediction and hand written digit recognition data sets. The results show a significant improvement over multitask learning with feature selection for larger number of tasks. Further, the developed algorithm is also compared against another state of the art algorithm that similarly groups the related tasks together and proven to be better and more accurate.",,,,, ,  2013 IEEE 13th International Conference on Data Mining,Chemicals;Slabs;Training;Vectors;Bayes methods;Equations;Mathematical model;Multi-task Learning;Expectation Propagation;Groups of Tasks;Spike and Slab Prior;Mixture of Gaussian Prior

It is essential to create therapies and drugs that target the cause of the disease. HD is caused by an increase in the soluble and mutant forms of the huntingtin protein (mHTT). SUMOylation of mHTT by Rhes (ras homolog enriched in striatum) through the E3 ligase domain triggers the solubility of mHTT. The SUMOylation of mHTT by Rhes is essential for its toxicity. The spread of mHTT through the brain is facilitated by its toxicity and tunneling nanotubes (TNTs). Inhibition of the cysteine 263 residue on Rhes prevents the formation of TNTs and the spread of mHTT. A model of Rhes and mHTT was constructed using constrained docking. Anchor residues in the protein complex were identified using the web server PocketQuery, which was used to construct small-molecule inhibitors using the web server LEA3D. Eight inhibitors were found through PocketQuery and LEA3D, and an inhibitor for cysteine 263 was created. In order to predict the activity of the inhibitors, a QSAR model was constructed using open-access data on E3 ligase inhibitors. Calculations for the pKd and Gibbs free energy yielded a two-tailed P value of 0.0408 for ${p K d}$ and 0.0409 for Gibbs free energy, indicating that the Rhes- mHTT inhibitors are more efficient than the controls. Blood brain barrier permeability was tested, and five out of the nine inhibitors were predicted as blood brain barrier permeable. Molecular dynamics simulations indicated that the best SUMO E3 ligase inhibitor (ARG260) and the cysteine 263 inhibitor were stable as they had an RMSD of under $2 \mathrm{~A}^{\circ}$. Retrosynthetic pathways for the inhibitors were also calculated to facilitate wet-lab synthesis using IBM RXN, which indicated high confidence, showing non- difficult synthesis. The inhibitors had low toxicity, with an Acute Oral Toxicity Class of 4 for both inhibitors. The created drugs can also be used as a prophylactic therapy to prevent symptom onset. HD is terrible, claiming millions of lives and tearing apart families. In addition, key interacting residues of the Rhes-mHTT complex were discovered to guide further drug discovery. It is essential to create new therapies to target the SUMOylation and spread of mHTT, such as small-molecule therapies, which this research aims to address.",,,,, ,  2024 IEEE 14th International Conference Nanomaterials: Applications & Properties (NAP),Proteins;Toxicology;Inhibitors;Medical treatment;Brain modeling;Web servers;Stability analysis;Blood;Diseases;Testing;Rhes;mutant huntingtin;de novo design;Huntington’s Disease

To address these problems, we propose a novel aggregation algorithm, which incorporates PCA operation and clustering to select the excellent client in each round; and brings in a momentum-accelerated historical quality gradient-based approach to increase the weight when the performances of the global model are consistently degraded, which can achieve faster convergence on the basis of ensuring that the update direction of the global model is not manipulated by malicious nodes.

After passing through the feature filtering module, the table was constructed based on the selected global features.

To this end, establishing a flat, non-curved strip is a key prerequisite to minimize coating thickness deviations and inhomogeneities. A common way to influence the lateral strip profile is to introduce a controlled plastic deformation of the strip at the guiding rolls in the zinc bath. This motivates a data-based study of the optimal roll intermesh value of the zinc bath rolls to achieve a flat (zero-crossbow) strip profile during the galvanizing process.

Unfortunately, only 45% of patients after a chemotherapy will respond to treatment. The aim of this study is to develop and validate a machine learning algorithm to predict response of individual liver mts, using CT scans. Understanding which mts will respond or not will help clinicians in providing a more efficient per-lesion treatment based on patient specific response and not only following a standard treatment.

Then, 75 radiomics features were extracted both from 7x7 ROIs that moved across the image and from the whole 3D mts. Feature selection was performed using a genetic algorithm. Results are presented as a comparison of the two different approaches of features extraction and different classification algorithms. Accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SE), specificity (SP), negative and positive predictive values (NPV and PPV) were evaluated for all lesions (per-lesion analysis) and patients (per-patient analysis) in the construction and validation sets.

Despite the ongoing endeavors to combat viral diseases, there exists a necessity to explore and develop novel therapeutic options. Antiviral peptides are bioactive molecules with a favorable toxicity profile, making them promising alternatives for viral infection treatment. Therefore, this article employed a generative adversarial network for antiviral peptide augmentation and a novel two-step authentication process for augmented synthetic peptides to enhance antiviral activity prediction. Additionally, five widely utilized deep learning models were employed for classification purposes. Initially, a GAN was used to augment the antiviral peptide. In a two-step authentication process, the NCBI-BLAST was utilized to identify the antiviral activity resemblance between the synthetic and real peptide. Subsequently, the hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, hydroxylic nature, positive charge, and negative charge of synthetic and authentic antiviral peptides were compared before their utilization. Later, to examine the impact of authenticated peptide augmentation in the prediction of antiviral peptides, a comparison is conducted with the outcomes of non-peptide augmented prediction. The study demonstrates that the 1-D convolution neural network with augmented peptide exhibits superior performance compared to other employed classifiers and state-of-the-art models.

A predictive ML model was used to identify improved self-nanoemulsifying systems including olive oil as base and combinations of Tween 20, Tween 80, glycerol, and soy lecithin.

This challenge has driven many researchers to use multitask learning for in silico predictions. Given extra information such as SMILES (simplified molecular input line entry system) as input data, existing multitask learning methods can usually have a good performance in predicting pharmacokinetics, which are served as labels/tasks. However, most of these methods are based solely on additional information, overlooking potentially available pharmacokinetics, which can be utilized to further enhance the prediction of unavailable ones. To address this limitation, we propose Label Enhanced MultiTask Learning (LEMTL), a framework to improve the prediction accuracy of unknown pharmacokinetics of existing multitask learning methods by aggregating shared feature representations learned from additional information and from known pharmacokinetics.

As datasets of small molecules become increasingly available, it becomes important to develop computational methods for the classification and analysis of small molecules and in particular for the prediction of their physical, chemical, and biological properties. We describe datasets and machine learning methods, in particular kernel methods, for chemical molecules represented by 1D strings, 2D graphs of bonds, and 3D structures.

Especially, based on cyclic voltammograms (CVs) obtained by electrochemical sensors, the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) has been widely attempted in the accurate quantification of drug concentrations, enabling the development of point-of-care and potentially system-level wearable devices. However, most of the work only considers the accuracy of how the predicted value is close to the actual value, which does not consider whether the predicted drug concentration is underestimated. In practical drug quantification, potential toxicity due to overexposure with underestimated quantification can lead to endangering the patient's body. Therefore, avoiding underestimating the concentration of drugs based on existing quantification models is required and necessary to optimize the conventional loss function at the output stage of ANN. In this letter, a novel loss function based on mean squared error (MSE), WeightedMSE, is proposed for avoiding underestimated quantification. It can be changed flexibly by adjusting parameters in order to adapt the acceptable overestimation range corresponding to the different types of drugs. A simulated dataset and a real dataset of etoposide and methotrexate are used as drug models, demonstrating that the proposed method can avoid underestimation in predicted values by over 98% in quantifying the concentration of multiple drugs and showing significant effectiveness for the development of point-of-care and wearable monitoring systems.",,,,, ,  ,Drugs;Feature extraction;Sensors;Vectors;Monitoring;Time division multiplexing;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Sensor applications;artificial neural network (ANN);cyclic voltammogram (CV);drug quantification;loss function;personalized therapy;therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM)

Life-threatening results were also reported in severe cases. Therefore, liver toxicity is an important assessment for new drug candidates. These reports are documented in research papers that contain preliminary in vitro and in vivo experiments. Conventionally, data extraction from publications relies on resource-demanding manual labeling, which restricts the efficiency of the information extraction. The development of natural language processing techniques enables the automatic processing of biomedical texts. Herein, based on around 28,000 papers (titles and abstracts) provided by the Critical Assessment of Massive Data Analysis challenge, this study benchmarked model performances on filtering liver-damage-related literature. Among five text embedding techniques, the model using term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) and logistic regression outperformed others with an accuracy of 0.957 on the validation set. Furthermore, an ensemble model with similar overall performances was developed with a logistic regression model on the predicted probability given by separate models with different vectorization techniques. The ensemble model achieved a high accuracy of 0.954 and an F1 score of 0.955 in the hold-out validation data in the challenge. Moreover, important words in positive/negative predictions were identified via model interpretation. The prediction reliability was quantified with conformal prediction, which provides users with a control over the prediction uncertainty.

We demonstrate this claim by analyzing four social computing datasets that are rated by crowd workers, showing that the agreement ratings are low despite deploying proper instructions and platform settings. Findings indicate that the more subjective the rating task, the lower the agreement, suggesting that tasks differ by their inherent subjectivity and that measuring the agreement of social computing tasks might not be the optimal way to ensure data quality. When creating subjective tasks, the use of agreement metrics potentially gives a false picture of the consistency of crowd workers, as they over-simplify the reality of obtaining quality labels. We also provide empirical evidence on the stability of crowd ratings with a different number of raters, items, and categories, finding that the reliability scores are most sensitive to the number categories, somewhat less sensitive to the number of raters, and the least sensitive to the number of items.

Accurate assessment of these properties during the early stages of drug development is challenging due to resource-intensive experimental evaluation and limited comprehensive data availability. To overcome these obstacles, there has been a growing reliance on computational and predictive tools, leveraging recent advancements in machine learning and graph-based methodologies. This study presents an innovative approach that harnesses the power of optimal transport (OT) theory to construct three graph kernels for predicting drug ADMET properties.

The OT-based graph kernels exhibits exceptional performance, outperforming state-of-the-art graph deep learning models in 9 out of 19 datasets, even surpassing the most impactful Graph Neural Network (GNN) that excels in 4 datasets.

Since molecules are often intrinsically described as molecular graphs, graph neural networks have recently been studied to improve the prediction of ADMET properties. Among many graph neural networks published in recent years, Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) is a relatively recent and very promising one. In this paper, we propose an enhanced GIN, called MolGIN, via exploiting the bond features and differences influence of the atom neighbors to end-to-end predict ADMET properties. Based on GIN, MolGIN concatenates the bond feature together with node feature in the feature aggregator and applies a gate unit to adjust the atomic neighborhood weights to map the differences in the interaction strength between the central atom and its neighbors, such that more meaningful structural patterns of molecules can be explored toward better molecular modeling. Extensive experiments were conducted on seven public datasets to evaluate MolGIN against four baseline models with benchmark metrics. Experimental results of MolGIN were also compared with state-of-the-art results published in the last three years on each dataset.

Here we developed a discriminant analysis and cluster (DAC) pipeline to analyze a 248-array dataset with 15,208 non-redundant earthworm (Eisenia fetida) gene probes on each array. Our objective was to identify biomarker genes that can separate earthworm samples into three groups: control (untreated), TNT-treated, and RDX-treated. First, the class comparison statistical algorithm implemented in BRB-ArrayTools was used to infer a total of 869 genes that significantly changed relative to controls as a result of exposure to TNT or RDX at various concentrations for 4 or 14 days. Then, nine tree-based supervised machine learning algorithms were applied to generate classification rules and a set of 286 classifier genes. These classifier genes were ranked by their overall weight of significance in the nine classification methods, and were used to build support vector machines (SVM). A SVM containing all 286 classifier genes had the highest classification accuracy (91.5%). Results of unsupervised clustering show that the use of the top 100 classifier genes can assign the largest number of the 248 worm samples into the three reference clusters obtained by using all the 14,188 filtered genes, suggesting that these top-ranked genes may be potential candidates for biomarkers.

For example, a spinned 1 summarization model outputs positive summaries of any text that mentions the name of some individual or organization.Model spinning introduces a “meta-backdoor” into a model. Whereas conventional backdoors cause models to produce incorrect outputs on inputs with the trigger, outputs of spinned models preserve context and maintain standard accuracy metrics, yet also satisfy a meta-task chosen by the adversary.Model spinning enables propaganda-as-a-service, where propaganda is defined as biased speech. An adversary can create customized language models that produce desired spins for chosen triggers, then deploy these models to generate disinformation (a platform attack), or else inject them into ML training pipelines (a supply-chain attack), transferring malicious functionality to downstream models trained by victims.To demonstrate the feasibility of model spinning, we develop a new backdooring technique. It stacks an adversarial meta-task (e.g., sentiment analysis) onto a seq2seq model, backpropagates the desired meta-task output (e.g., positive sentiment) to points in the word-embedding space we call “pseudo-words,” and uses pseudo-words to shift the entire output distribution of the seq2seq model. We evaluate this attack on language generation, summarization, and translation models with different triggers and meta-tasks such as sentiment, toxicity, and entailment. Spinned models largely maintain their accuracy metrics (ROUGE and BLEU) while shifting their outputs to satisfy the adversary’s meta-task. We also show that, in the case of a supply-chain attack, the spin functionality transfers to downstream models.Finally, we propose a black-box, meta-task-independent defense that, given a list of candidate triggers, can detect models that selectively apply spin to inputs with any of these triggers.1We use “spinned” rather than “spun” to match how the word is used in public relations.",,,,, ,  2022 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP),Measurement;Training;Analytical models;Toxicology;Training data;Media;Data models

To address this, we have built and evaluated several Machine Learning (ML) and rule-based models. Our approach is focused on three aspects: i) selection of three new high-quality datasets, DILI-876, DILI-955, and DILI-1148 from DILIst (DILI severity and toxicity) dataset, by applying several scientific criteria. The datasets DILI-876, DILI-955, and DILI-1148 contain drugs that fall within three chemical spaces, namely, drugs with molecular weights of ⩽500, ⩽ 750, and ""no molecular weight bias"" respectively. ii) Evaluation of the influence of three types of data division methods and chemical features on model performance. iii) Evaluation of four ML and one rule-based method for developing reliable DILI models. These efforts resulted in high-performing DILI models that are superior to reported ML models, based on AUC, F1, specificity, and most significantly, with superior performance in the case of DILI positive and negative drugs. The test set characteristics of the best ANN DILI model developed using DILI-876 are AUC-0.908, accuracy-0.804, sensitivity-0.804, specificity-0.815, balanced accuracy-0.809, MCC-0.594, precision-0.821, and F1-0.807. The best SVM DILI models showed similar performance characteristics. The order of predictive performance of the ML models derived from the three datasets is DILI-876>DILI-955>DILI-1148, and the order of performance of the ML methods is ANN~SVM>LR>RF. The order of performance of the models built using the three chemical features is fingerprints>descriptors>fragments. From the performance analysis of our models for individual chemical and DILI classes, we infer that our models performed equally well for DILI negative drugs e.g., the success level of prediction is 81.355% for ""vNo"" drugs, as reflected by the excellent specificity of the models for the imbalanced DILI data. Similarly, they performed equally well in the case of DILI positives, as reflected by the excellent sensitivity of our models.

To address these hurdles, computational and predictive tools have gained prominence, capitalizing on recent advances in machine learning and graph-based methodologies.

To address this issue, we develop a novel semisupervised heterogeneous network embedding algorithm (called SeHNE) to predict drug combinations, where ATC similarity of drugs, drug-target and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks are integrated to construct heterogeneous network. SeHNE jointly learns features of drugs by exploiting the topological structure of heterogeneous networks, and prediction of drug combination.

Accurate segmentation of OARs prevents/minimizes unwanted toxicity to healthy tissues. Manual segmentation is time-consuming, tedious, prone to human errors and subject to intra- and inter-observer variability. In this regard, deep learning algorithms have shown extraordinary performance in automated organ segmentation from medical images, though the powerful/highly effective models might be computationally intensive. Transferring knowledge from complex/cumbersome models to simple/versatile models, known as knowledge distillation, has been proposed to address this issue (enhance the performance of the existing deep learning models). In this work, the impact of the knowledge distillation on OARs segmentation from CT images is investigated for commonly used Unet and Resnet deep learning models. To this end, a highly complex Unet model (as teacher) and two conventional deep learning models (Unet and Resnet as students) were developed to delineate OARs on thoracic CT images from the SegTHOR public dataset. The models were trained once independently and once through knowledge distillation from the teacher model to the student models.

Harmful DDIs can reduce drug efficacy and even increase unintended toxicity, putting patients treated with different drugs at risk. Previous works on DDI prediction mainly rely on hand-engineered domain knowledge, which is laborious to obtain and cannot handle the problem of sparse positive samples in DDI prediction. Even though some works attempt to handle data sparsity from the perspective of data distribution to improve the generalization ability of the model, they are limited to negative samples distribution. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method, Graph Mixup for Positive Sample Augmentation (GMPSA), to effectively combine positive drug molecule graphs and extend the training distribution to alleviate the problem of sparse positive samples. To model the graph signals and graph structures jointly, we map source graphs to the fused gromov-wasserstein metric space, then minimizes the weighted sum of transportation distances between the distributions of the source graphs and the objective graph in this metric space. By doing so, interpolated positive samples improve the the generalization error of the model. Experiments results on a real-word dataset show that our method effectively improve the perfomermance in DDI prediction on a state-of-the-art architecture. Further studies also verify the robustness and generalizability of GMPSA under different GNN backbones and parameter settings.",,,,, ,  2023 IEEE International Conference on Medical Artificial Intelligence (MedAI),Drugs;Training;Toxicology;Transportation;Transforms;Robustness;Task analysis;drug-drug interaction prediction;data augmentation;imbalance problem;graph neural networks

From social media networks to online forums and comment sections on news sites, the harmful behavior of cyberbullying manifests in many forms, including harassment, threats, and demeaning comments. This ubiquity underscores the need for effective detection mechanisms. This paper explores the identification of toxic traits in online comments using advanced hybrid models, specifically BERT-CNN and BERT-LSTM. The research methodology involved constructing and configuring multiple layers within these models to optimize their ability to detect harmful content. For the BERT-CNN model, BERT's powerful language understanding capabilities are combined with CNN's strength in feature extraction through convolutional layers, capturing spatial hierarchies of features. In the BERT-LSTM model, BERT is integrated with LSTM layers to leverage their ability to learn long-term dependencies and sequential patterns in text. Various configurations of these models were tested, including adj ustments in the batch sizes and the length of the word tokens, to enhance performance in identifying toxic language. The best model which is BERT-CNN using the configuration 256 as the unit and 32 as the batch size achieved 94.48% accuracy in detecting toxic comments. The result from the model indicates that by harnessing BERT's contextual embeddings and the respective benefits of CNN's and LSTM's processing capabilities, it is possible to significantly reduce the frequency of cyberbullying through effective detection, ultimately fostering safer online environments across different media platforms.",,,,, ,  2024 International Conference on Information Management and Technology (ICIMTech),Adaptation models;Visualization;Accuracy;Transfer learning;Cyberbullying;Media;Feature extraction;Information management;Convolutional neural networks;Long short term memory;toxic comment detection;BERT;LSTM;CNN;cyberbullying

Social media, community forums, discussion platforms are few examples of common playground of online discussions where people are freely allowed to communicate. However, the freedom of speech may be misused by some people by arguing aggressively, offending others and spreading verbal violence. As there is no clear distinction between the terms offensive, abusive, hate and toxic speech, in this paper we consider the above mentioned terms as toxic speech. In many countries, online toxic speech is punishable by the law. Thus, it is important to automatically detect and remove toxic speech from online medias. Through this work, we propose automatic classification of toxic speech using embedding representations of words and deep-learning techniques. We perform binary and multi-class classification using a Twitter corpus and study two approaches: (a) a method which consists in extracting of word embeddings and then using a DNN classifier; (b) fine-tuning the pre-trained BERT model.

However, many people often use social media to spread hate speech and abusive languages. In contrast to hate speech, abusive languages are frequently used as jokes with no purpose of offending individuals or groups, even though they may contain profanities. As a result, the distinction between hate speech and abusive language is often blurred. In many cases, individuals who spread hate speech may be prosecuted as it has legal implications. Previous research has focused on binary classification of hate speech and normal tweets. This study aims to classify hate speech, abusive language, and normal messages on Indonesian Twitter. Several machine learning models, such as logistic regression and BERT models, are utilized to accomplish text classification tasks. The model's performance is assessed using the F1-Score evaluation metric. The results show that BERT models outperform other models in terms of F1-Score, with the BERT-indobenchmark model, which was pretrained on social media text data, achieving the highest F1-Score of 85.59. This also demonstrates that pretraining the BERT model using social media data improves the classification model significantly.

This study compared the behavioral characteristics, perspectives, and emotional expressions of players in Souls-like games from different cultural backgrounds, specifically examining the distinctions and commonalities among them. Natural language processing techniques were employed to analyze English, Chinese, and Russian reviews of 17 Souls-like games to investigate players' gaming experiences, including gameplay behaviors, game evaluations, and emotional experiences. The findings revealed significant disparities among players from different cultures in all three aspects of their engagement with Souls-like games. Specifically, these players exhibited significant culture-related variations in their behavioral characteristics toward Souls-like games. In terms of perspectives, English-speaking players tended to focus more on game optimization, whereas Chinese and Russian players paid greater attention to game combat design. Regarding emotional expressions, Chinese players were more prone to exhibit emotions of anger and disgust, while English and Russian players displayed a more neutral emotional stance. These cultural insights provide valuable information for game developers to better meet the needs and expectations of players from different cultural backgrounds. This study not only broadens our understanding of player behaviors and cultural influences but also lends robust support to cross-cultural gaming research.",,,,, ,  ,Games;Cultural differences;Behavioral sciences;Social networking (online);Video games;History;Emotion recognition;Cultural difference;emotion detection;game reviews;human factors in games;Souls-like games;topic modeling

In this paper, we disclose a new threat to LLMs alignment when a malicious actor has access to the top-k token predictions at each output position of the model, such as in all open-source LLMs and many commercial LLMs that provide the needed APIs (e.g., some GPT versions). It does not require crafting any prompt. Instead, it leverages the observation that even when an LLM declines a toxic query, the harmful response is concealed deep within the output logits. We can coerce the model to disclose it by forcefully using low-ranked output tokens during auto-regressive output generation, and such forcing is only needed in a very small number of selected output positions. We call it model interrogation. Since our method operates differently from jail-breaking, it has better effectiveness than state-of-the- art jail-breaking techniques (92% versus 62%) and is 10 to 20 times faster. The toxic content elicited by our method is also of better quality. More importantly, it is complementary to jail-breaking, and a synergetic integration of the two exhibits superior performance over individual methods.

Particularly in ongoing interaction scenarios with users, it remains unclear whether there is generative content risk drift over time. In this context, ""drift risk"" refers to the trend of progressively intensified content risk that emerges during sustained adversarial interactions among LLM agents. Additionally, the high cost associated with constructing complex adversarial environments for agents impedes the transferability of current assessment methods for LLMs to multi-agent adversarial scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a low-cost and lightweight framework for assessing content risk drift of LLMs, named CRDA. This framework, bypassing the need for constructing complex adversarial environments, offers a method that integrates roles and responses memory to guide automatically multi-round adversarial interactions among LLM agents, that is, multiple agents as avatars of a single LLM. In this approach, LLM agents enable the analysis of content risk drift of this LLM. Moreover, we explore the impact of restricted roles and the unsafe content with negative viewpoints in responses memory on the content risk drift of LLMs. Considering the rapid advancement of Chinese LLM capabilities, this study selects real adversarial topics in Chinese and assesses content risk drift of five representative Chinese LLMs. The research finds that these LLMs exhibit significant content risk drift even after a certain safety alignment, showing an initial increase followed by a gradual decrease. As the adversarial process progresses, under restricted roles, agents more effectively breach the model's safety alignment, leading to content risk drift of the LLM. The content drift risk assessment can be quantified specifically by measuring the deterioration rate at which LLM agents deteriorate from positive to negative and analyzing the underlying trends during the automatically multi-round adversarial interactions. In restricted and general roles adversarial interactions, all agents of five Chinese LLMs exhibit an overall average increase of 31.5% and 16.38% in the cumulative deterioration rate respectively by the 10th round, compared to the baseline no-roles adversarial interactions. Finally, we hope that the framework and findings presented in this paper will offer valuable insights for research on safety alignment in LLM agents during adversarial processes.",,,,, ,  2024 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN),Costs;Large language models;Avatars;Neural networks;Collaboration;Market research;Safety

Until now, such attacks have primarily targeted visual models, exploiting the gap between human and machine perception. Although text-based models have also been attacked with adversarial examples, such attacks struggled to preserve semantic meaning and indistinguishability. In this paper, we explore a large class of adversarial examples that can be used to attack text-based models in a black-box setting without making any human-perceptible visual modification to inputs. We use encoding-specific perturbations that are imperceptible to the human eye to manipulate the outputs of a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems from neural machine-translation pipelines to web search engines. We find that with a single imperceptible encoding injection – representing one invisible character, homoglyph, reordering, or deletion – an attacker can significantly reduce the performance of vulnerable models, and with three injections most models can be functionally broken. Our attacks work against currently-deployed commercial systems, including those produced by Microsoft and Google, in addition to open source models published by Facebook, IBM, and HuggingFace. This novel series of attacks presents a significant threat to many language processing systems: an attacker can affect systems in a targeted manner without any assumptions about the underlying model.

Often these comments involving racial abuse, hate based on religion, caste are made by anonymous people over the internet, and it is quite a task to keep these comments under control. So, the objective was to develop a Machine Learning Model to help identify these comments. A Deep Learning Model (a sequential model) was made and it was trained to identify and classify a comment based on whether it is an apt comment or not. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is particularly well-suited for modeling sequential data, such as text. LSTMs are capable of modeling long-term dependencies in sequential data. In the case of text classification, this means that LSTMs can take into account the context of a word or phrase within a sentence, paragraph, or even an entire document. LSTMs can learn to selectively forget or remember information from the past, which is useful for filtering out noise or irrelevant information in text. LSTMs are well-established in the field of natural language processing (NLP) and have been shown to be effective for various NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis and text classification. Binary cross-entropy is a commonly used loss function in deep learning models for binary classification problems, such as predicting whether a comment is toxic or not. Binary cross-entropy is designed to optimize the model's predictions based on the binary nature of the classification task. It penalizes the model for assigning a low probability to the correct class and rewards it for assigning a high probability to the correct class. The loss function is differentiable, which allows gradient-based optimization methods to be used during training to minimize the loss and improve the model's performance. Binary cross-entropy is a well-established loss function that has been extensively used in the field of deep learning, and there are many tools and frameworks that support it, making it easy to implement in practice. Binary cross-entropy also has a probabilistic interpretation, which can be useful in some applications. For example, it can be used to estimate the probability that a given comment is toxic. Hence, Binary Cross Entropy has been chosen as the loss function for the Deep Learning model.",,,,, ,"  2023 International Conference in Advances in Power, Signal, and Information Technology (APSIT)",Deep learning;Training;Sentiment analysis;Recurrent neural networks;Social networking (online);Text categorization;Predictive models;comment;toxicity;deep learning;sequential model

However, due to the unique language properties of Chinese, it is not trivial to extend existing defenses to the Chinese domain. Therefore, we propose AdvGraph, a novel defense which enhances the robustness of Chinese-based NLP models by incorporating adversarial knowledge into the semantic representation of the input. Extensive experiments on two real-world tasks show that AdvGraph exhibits better performance compared with previous work: (i) effective – it significantly strengthens the model robustness even under the adaptive attacks setting without negative impact on model performance over legitimate input; (ii) generic – its key component, i.e., the representation of connotative adversarial knowledge is task-agnostic, which can be reused in any Chinese-based NLP models without retraining; and (iii) efficient – it is a light-weight defense with sub-linear computational complexity, which can guarantee the efficiency required in practical scenarios.",,,,, ,"  ICASSP 2021 - 2021 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)",Adaptation models;Computational modeling;Conferences;Semantics;Neural networks;Signal processing;Natural language processing;Adversarial examples;model robustness;adversarial defense

Currently, garbage collection involves regular garbage trucks that pick-up garbage once a week in every zone of the city, which is a highly inefficient use of government resources. In this work, a web-based system is proposed to manage the large amount of garbage collected daily while also providing a better solution. The system involves users renting dumpsters to collect waste generated in their respective areas, which will then be decomposed at designated dumping yards.

However, they have been increasingly exploited to propagate toxic content, such as hate speech, malicious advertisement, and pornography, which can lead to highly negative impacts (e.g., harmful effects on teen mental health). Researchers and practitioners have been enthusiastically developing and extensively deploying textual content moderation software to address this problem. However, we find that malicious users can evade moderation by changing only a few words in the toxic content. Moreover, modern content moderation software's performance against malicious inputs remains underexplored. To this end, we propose MTTM, a Metamorphic Testing framework for Textual content Moderation software. Specifically, we conduct a pilot study on 2, 000 text messages collected from real users and summarize eleven metamorphic relations across three perturbation levels: character, word, and sentence. MTTM employs these metamorphic relations on toxic textual contents to generate test cases, which are still toxic yet likely to evade moderation. In our evaluation, we employ MTTM to test three commercial textual content moderation software and two state-of-the-art moderation algorithms against three kinds of toxic content. The results show that MTTM achieves up to 83.9%, 51%, and 82.5% error finding rates (EFR) when testing commercial moderation software provided by Google, Baidu, and Huawei, respectively, and it obtains up to 91.2% EFR when testing the state-of-the-art algorithms from the academy. In addition, we leverage the test cases generated by MTTM to retrain the model we explored, which largely improves model robustness 0% ~ 5.9% EFR) while maintaining the accuracy on the original test set.

This is usually manifested when the patient suffers from more than one disease for which drugs are prescribed and/or more than one drug is needed to be prescribed. The problem is made worse by the wide range of available drugs and the complexity which characterizes the variety of possible interactions or adverse effects. Determining potential drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is essential in any drug prescription. However, this process is not easy taking into consideration that medical and clinical data is continually increasing. Formal representation of the underlying knowledge is needed to provide comprehensive study of potential DDI. The ultimate aim of this work is to develop and use ontology for identifying DDI. DDI effects were classified into three types: toxic reaction, reduction effect or synergism effect. In this paper, the mechanism of action of drugs was considered to describe the proven general properties and action of drugs. Three scenarios were created to show the ability of description Logic (DL) reasoner of the proposed ontology to provide a proper classification of the DDI effects. In another words, describing the characteristics of any class will enable the DL reasoner to automatically recognize any individual that is an instance of this class. The study shows an efficient classification based on the defined ontology.

That is the case with online antisemitism, the specific category of hatred considered in this study. Tracking antisemitic themes and their associated terminology over time in online discussions could help monitor the sentiments of their participants and their evolution, and possibly offer avenues for intervention that may prevent the escalation of hatred. Due to the large volume and constant evolution of online traffic, monitoring conversations manually is impractical. Instead, we propose an automated method that extracts antisemitic themes and terminology from extremist social media over time and captures their evolution. Since supervised learning would be too limited for such a task, we created an unsupervised online machine learning approach that uses large language models to assess the contextual similarity of posts. The method clusters similar posts together, dividing, and creating additional clusters over time when subthemes emerge from existing ones or new themes appear. The antisemitic terminology used within each theme is extracted from the posts in each cluster. Our experiments show that our methodology outperforms existing baselines and demonstrates the kind of themes and sub-themes it discovers within antisemitic discourse along with their associated terminology.

In Indonesia, some words can have more than one meaning (polysemy), which can lead to ambiguity of meaning. One example of an Indonesian word with an ambiguous meaning is ‘bisa’. Based on Indonesia Dictionary (KBBI), it has three meanings (capable, toxic substance, and greeting shaman in the traditional ‘pingitan’ ceremony).

The gross factors involved are the ease of ignition, the rapidity of combustion development, the severity of conditions produced by the combustion (heat, smoke and toxic gas loads), and the performance of a product under a fire load. Most flammability tests have been developed by practical people under external pressures (legal or corporate) to produce a believable, reproducible test requiring a minimum of effort, equipment, and manpower. The scientific understanding of the tests is a luxury usually denied the designers. The resulting tests each measure some aspect of flammability, usually reproducible and well. However, because of thtlack of basic understanding, related tests measure different aspects of flammability and correlate poorly. There is a need for increased effort in understanding tests scientifically to aid in correlating and interpreting the results. A side result of this situation is that a jargon has developed which often obscures the usage and basis of the tests. This paper will document the chaotic state of flammability testing, define some of the specialized terms, and close with some suggestions for the scientific interpretation of some aspects of wire and cable testing as an example of the approach which the author feels would increase understanding in this field.",,,,, ,  ,

To address these issues, we introduce GitRev, a novel approach that applies gamification mechanisms to boost developer motivation and engagement. GitRev is built on top of a Large Language Model (LLM), used as a points-based reward system that leverages the code change context, and code review activities.

Machine learning models are here proposed to optimize such multivariate calibration. However, the acquisition of big experimental data is time and resource consuming in practice, necessitating new paradigms and efficient models for these data-limited frameworks. Therefore, a novel approach is presented in this work, where a multi-ion-sensing emulator is designed to explain the response of an ion-sensing array in a mixed-ion environment. A case study is performed emulating the concurrent monitoring of sodium, potassium, lithium, and lead ions, in a medium representative of sweat samples. These analytes are relevant examples of sweat ion-sensing applications for physiology, therapeutic drug monitoring, and heavy metal contamination. It is demonstrated that calibration datasets output by the emulator explain accurately the experimental response of polymeric solid-contact ion-selective electrodes, where root-mean-squared error of 1.37, 1.44, 1.78, 2 mV are obtained, respectively, for Na+, K+, Li+, Pb2+ sensor calibration in artificial sweat.

Being a parallel corpus, also with respect to the original English CONAN, it allows to perform novel research on multilingual and crosslingual automatic generation of CNs. Our experiments on CN generation with mT5, a multilingual encoder-decoder model, shows that generation greatly benefits from training on post-edited data, as opposed to relying on silver MT data only. These results are confirmed by their correlation with a qualitative manual evaluation, demonstrating that manually revised training data remains crucial for the quality of the generated CNs. Furthermore, multilingual data augmentation improves results over monolingual settings for structurally similar languages such as English and Spanish, while being detrimental for Basque, a language isolate. Similar findings occur in zero-shot crosslingual evaluations, where model transfer (fine-tuning in English and generating in a different target language) outperforms fine-tuning mT5 on machine translated data for Spanish but not for Basque.

Unfortunately, these pretrained language models are used almost universally in downstream tasks, and natural language processing is often applied to make real-world predictions. Thus, debiasing these language models as early in development as possible is increasingly crucial for preventing unintentional harms caused by natural language systems. To this end, we propose a new technique called partitioned contrastive gradient unlearning (PCGU), a gray-box method for debiasing pretrained masked language models. PCGU aims to optimize only the weights that contribute most to a specific domain of bias, doing so by computing a first-order approximation based on the gradients of contrastive sentence pairs. Our experiments show that PCGU is both low-cost and seems particularly effective at pinpointing the sources of implicit social bias in large pretrained transformers. Although we train using PCGU in the gender-profession domain only, we find that doing so can also partially mitigate bias across other domains.

In this paper, we explore how this generation can be further controlled at decoding time to satisfy certain constraints (e.g. being non-toxic, conveying certain emotions, using a specific writing style, etc.) without fine-tuning the LM.Precisely, we formalize constrained generation as a tree exploration process guided by a discriminator that indicates how well the associated sequence respects the constraint. This approach, in addition to being easier and cheaper to train than fine-tuning the LM, allows to apply the constraint more finely and dynamically. We propose several original methods to search this generation tree, notably the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) which provides theoretical guarantees on the search efficiency, but also simpler methods based on re-ranking a pool of diverse sequences using the discriminator scores. These methods are evaluated, with automatic and human-based metrics, on two types of constraints and languages: review polarity and emotion control in French and English. We show that discriminator-guided MCTS decoding achieves state-of-the-art results without having to tune the language model, in both tasks and languages. We also demonstrate that other proposed decoding methods based on re-ranking can be really effective when diversity among the generated propositions is encouraged.",,,,, ,  Proceedings of the 2022 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies,

This paper presents UCTG, a unified controllable text generation framework, which introduces a novel prompt learning method for CTG. Specifically, this framework seamlessly integrates a control module, a prompt module, and a generation module. The control module leverages a fine-tuned model to distill user preference features and behavioral patterns from historical data, incorporating human feedback into the model`s loss functions. These features are then transformed by the prompt module into vectors that guide the generation module. As such, the text generation can be flexibly controlled without modifying the task settings. By employing this unified approach, UCTG significantly improves query accuracy and coherence in tasks with different objectives and constraints, which is validated by extensive experiments on the Meituan and AOL real-world datasets.

In this way, CDMs can be more effectively combined with PLMs. Additionally, considering that existing noise schedules in text diffusion models do not take into account the linguistic differences among tokens, which violates the easy-first policy for text generation, we propose a linguistic easy-first schedule that incorporates the measure of word importance, conforming to easy-first-generation linguistic features and bringing about improved generation quality.

To mitigate this issue, we introduce Meta-MCTG, a training framework incorporating meta-learning, where we enable models to learn how to generalize by simulating compositional generalization scenarios in the training phase.

These approaches, while effective, demand extensive computational and data resources. In contrast, some proposed learning-free alternatives circumvent learning but often yield inferior results, exemplifying the fundamental machine learning trade-off between computational expense and model efficacy. To overcome these limitations, we propose FreeCtrl, a learning-free approach that dynamically adjusts the weights of selected feedforward neural network (FFN) vectors to steer the outputs of large language models (LLMs). FreeCtrl hinges on the principle that the weights of different FFN vectors influence the likelihood of different tokens appearing in the output. By identifying and adaptively adjusting the weights of attribute-related FFN vectors, FreeCtrl can control the output likelihood of attribute keywords in the generated content. Extensive experiments on single- and multi-attribute control reveal that the learning-free FreeCtrl outperforms other learning-free and learning-based methods, successfully resolving the dilemma between learning costs and model performance.",,,,, ,  Proceedings of the 62nd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers),

Secondly, we empower the decoder to control the level of hallucination in the generated text by employing a controllable text generation technique.

"Wang, Hao, Sha, Lei",,,Harnessing the Plug-and-Play Controller by Prompting,,, , ,2023,"Controllable text generation is a growing field within natural language generation (NLG) that focuses on producing text that meets specific constraints in real-world applications. Previous approaches, such as plug-and-play controllers (PPCs), aimed to steer the properties of generated text in a flexible manner. However, these methods often compromised the integrity of the language model`s decoding process, resulting in less smooth text generation.Alternatively, other techniques utilized multiple attribute prompts to align the generated text with desired attributes, but this approach required prompt design for each attribute and was dependent on the size of the language model. This paper introduces a novel method for flexible attribute control in text generation using pre-trained language models (PLMs). The proposed approach aims to enhance the fluency of generated text by guiding the generation process with PPCs. The key idea is to dynamically adjust the distribution of generated text by modifying prompts, effectively constraining the output space of the language model and influencing the desired attribute. To enable smooth cooperation between the PLM and the PPC, our work innovativel proposes a new model fine-tuning method: Reinforcement Learning with Dynamic Adjust Feedback (RLDAF).This fine-tuning process adapts a small subset of the language model`s parameters based on the generating actions taken during the PPC control process. The resulting harmonious collaboration between the PLM and PPC leads to improved smoothness in text generation during inference.

As such, if the complexity of an input text prompt is rated first-grade reading level in the Flesch Reading Ease test, then the generated text continuing the plot should also be within this range of complexity. With this in mind, we introduce Uniform Complexity for Text Generation (UCTG), a new benchmark test which raises the challenge of making generative models observe uniform linguistic properties with respect to prompts.

Besides, many methods guide the inference in its word-by-word generation, pushing the word probability to the target attributes, resulting in less fluent sentences.

In this work, we bridge this gap and study techniques to generate summaries at specified readability levels.

We develop three text generation techniques for controlling readability: (1) instruction-based readability control, (2) reinforcement learning to minimize the gap between requested and observed readability and (3) a decoding approach that uses lookahead to estimate the readability of upcoming decoding steps.

In this work, we propose DuNST, a novel ST framework to tackle these problems. DuNST jointly models text generation and classification as a dual process and further perturbs and escapes from the collapsed space by adding two kinds of flexible noise. In this way, our model could construct and utilize both pseudo text generated from given labels and pseudo labels predicted from available unlabeled text, which are gradually refined during the ST phase.

Many of the existing style transfer benchmarks primarily focus on individual high-level semantic changes (e.g. positive to negative), which enable controllability at a high level but do not offer fine-grained control involving sentence structure, emphasis, and content of the sentence. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale benchmark, StylePTB, with (1) paired sentences undergoing 21 fine-grained stylistic changes spanning atomic lexical, syntactic, semantic, and thematic transfers of text, as well as (2) compositions of multiple transfers which allow modeling of fine-grained stylistic changes as building blocks for more complex, high-level transfers. By benchmarking existing methods on StylePTB, we find that they struggle to model fine-grained changes and have an even more difficult time composing multiple styles. As a result, StylePTB brings novel challenges that we hope will encourage future research in controllable text style transfer, compositional models, and learning disentangled representations. Solving these challenges would present important steps towards controllable text generation.",,,,, ,  Proceedings of the 2021 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies,

In this paper, we use a threat model to demonstrate that the publicly available language models can reliably generate biased news content based on an input original news. We also show that a large number of high-quality biased news articles can be generated using controllable text generation.

However, training GAN often suffers from mode collapse problem, which causes that the transferred text is little related to the original text. In this paper, we propose a new GAN model with a word-level conditional architecture and a two-phase training procedure. By using a style-related condition architecture before generating a word, our model is able to maintain style-unrelated words while changing the others. By separating the training procedure into reconstruction and transfer phases, our model is able to learn a proper text generation process, which further improves the content preservation.

We discuss the gaps and challenges of toxicity detection approaches - from blocklist-based approaches to sophisticated state-of-the-art neural classifiers - by evaluating them on the text prediction task for English against a manually crafted CheckList of harms targeted at different groups and different levels of severity.",,,,, ,  Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EACL 2023,

We run experiments on two covert toxicity datasets with two types of references: 1) information retrieved from a search API, and 2) interpretations generated by large language models.

Our experiments are conducted on six different toxicity datasets, four of whom are hateful and two are toxic in the broader sense. We then employ a classifier trained on the original data for filtering. To explore the potential of this data, we conduct experiments using combinations of original and synthetic data, synthetic oversampling of the minority class, and a comparison of original vs. synthetic-only training. Results indicate that while our generative models offer benefits in certain scenarios, it does not improve hateful dataset classification. However, it does boost patronizing and condescending language detection.

Most state-of-the-art span detection approaches employ various techniques, each of which can be broadly classified into Token Classification or Span Prediction approaches. In our paper, we explore simple versions of both of these approaches and their performance on the task. Specifically, we use BERT-based models - BERT, RoBERTa, and SpanBERT for both approaches. We also combine these approaches and modify them to bring improvements for Toxic Spans prediction. To this end, we investigate results on four hybrid approaches - Multi-Span, Span+Token, LSTM-CRF, and a combination of predicted offsets using union/intersection. Additionally, we perform a thorough ablative analysis and analyze our observed results. Our best submission - a combination of SpanBERT Span Predictor and RoBERTa Token Classifier predictions - achieves an F1 score of 0.6753 on the test set. Our best post-eval F1 score is 0.6895 on intersection of predicted offsets from top-3 RoBERTa Token Classification checkpoints.

To this end, recent research has explored how models rely on spurious correlations, and how counterfactual data augmentation (CDA) can mitigate such issues. In this paper we study how and why modeling counterfactuals over multiple attributes can go significantly further in improving model performance. We propose RDI, a context-aware methodology which takes into account the impact of secondary attributes on the model`s predictions and increases sensitivity for secondary attributes over reweighted counterfactually augmented data. By implementing RDI in the context of toxicity detection, we find that accounting for secondary attributes can significantly improve robustness, with improvements in sliced accuracy on the original dataset up to 7{\%} compared to existing robustness methods. We also demonstrate that RDI generalizes to the coreference resolution task and provide guidelines to extend this to other tasks.",,,,, ,  Proceedings of the 2021 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,

In view of this, we introduce a Context-aware Model self-Detoxification (CMD) framework that pays attention to both the context and the detoxification process, i.e., first detoxifying the context and then making the language model generate along the safe context. Specifically, CMD framework involves two phases: utilizing language models to synthesize data and applying these data for training.

To address this challenge, our paper introduces an novel framework that utilizes the critique capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce intermediate-step rewards during RL training. Our method involves coupling a policy model with a critic language model, which is responsible for providing comprehensive feedback of each part of the output. This feedback is then translated into token or span-level rewards that can be used to guide the RL training process. We investigate this approach under two different settings: one where the policy model is smaller and is paired with a more powerful critic model, and another where a single language model fulfills both roles. We assess our approach on three text generation tasks: sentiment control, language model detoxification, and summarization. Experimental results show that incorporating artificial intrinsic rewards significantly improve both sample efficiency and the overall performance of the policy model, supported by both automatic and human evaluation.",,,,, ,  Proceedings of the 2024 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,

We name such steers LM-Steers and find them existing in LMs of all sizes. It requires learning parameters equal to 0.2{\%} of the original LMs' size for steering each style. On tasks such as language model detoxification and sentiment control, LM-Steers can achieve comparable or superior performance compared with state-of-the-art controlled generation methods while maintaining a better balance with generation quality. The learned LM-Steer serves as a lens in text styles: it reveals that word embeddings are interpretable when associated with language model generations and can highlight text spans that most indicate the style differences. An LM-Steer is transferrable between different language models by an explicit form calculation. One can also continuously steer LMs simply by scaling the LM-Steer or compose multiple LM-Steers by adding their transformations.

Text detoxification is a crucial task in natural language processing to ensure the generation of non-toxic and safe text. Text detoxification is a special case of the Text Style Transfer (TST) problem, where an input text is rephrased to an output text that preserves its content while modifying the style (in this case to a more neutral, non-toxic style). State-of-the-art methods for detoxification use supervised training of encoder-decoder models to produce gold-standard outputs with a standard likelihood-based objective. However, it can be hard for these models to deviate from their pretrained auto-encoder identity mapping. While previous methods have used unlikelihood-based losses to penalize input-to-output copying of toxic content, these methods also unfortunately penalize non-toxic content in the input that would be fine to preserve in the output. To address these issues, we introduce a novel contrastive unlikelihood objective (COUNT) that directly contrasts the gold standard rephrasing with the identity input-to-output mapping to effectively isolate and focus learning on non-toxic style transfer.

"Yang, Wenkai, Hao, Yunzhuo, Lin, Yankai",,,Exploring Backdoor Vulnerabilities of Chat Models,,, , ,2025,"Recent researches have shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) are susceptible to a security threat known as Backdoor Attack. The backdoored model will behave well in normal cases but exhibit malicious behaviours on inputs inserted with a specific backdoor trigger. Current backdoor studies on LLMs predominantly focus on single-turn instruction-tuned LLMs, while neglecting another realistic scenario where LLMs are fine-tuned on multi-turn conversational data to be chat models. Chat models are extensively adopted across various real-world scenarios, thus the security of chat models deserves increasing attention. Unfortunately, we point out that the flexible multi-turn interaction format instead increases the flexibility of trigger designs and amplifies the vulnerability of chat models to backdoor attacks. In this work, we reveal and achieve a novel backdoor attacking method on chat models by distributing multiple trigger scenarios across user inputs in different rounds, and making the backdoor be triggered only when all trigger scenarios have appeared in the historical conversations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve high attack success rates (e.g., over 90{\%} ASR on Vicuna-7B) while successfully maintaining the normal capabilities of chat models on providing helpful responses to benign user requests. Also, the backdoor cannot be easily removed by the downstream re-alignment, highlighting the importance of continued research and attention to the security concerns of chat models.

To isolate this recovery faculty of language models, we study a new diagnostic task {---}Adversarial Word Recovery {---} an extension of spellchecking where the inputs may be adversarial. We collect a new dataset using 9 popular perturbation attack strategies from the literature and organize them using a taxonomy of phonetic, typo, and visual attacks. We use this dataset to study the word recovery performance of the current generation of LLMs, finding that proprietary models (GPT-4, GPT-3.5 and Palm-2) match or surpass human performance. Conversely, open-source models (Llama-2, Mistral, Falcon) demonstrate a material gap between human performance, especially on visual attacks. For these open models, we show that performance of word recovery without context correlates to word recovery with context, and ultimately affects downstream task performance on a hateful, offensive, and toxic classification task. Finally, to show improving word recovery can improve robustness, we mitigate these attacks with a small Byt5 model tuned to recover visually attacked words.",,,,, ,  Proceedings of the 31st International Conference on Computational Linguistics,

In the context of fine-tuning a WMT19 German-to-English model into a Guarani Mbya-to-English translator, we first show, with two commonly-used Machine Translation metrics, that using only Bible data is not enough to create successful translators for everyday sentences gathered from a dictionary. Indeed, even fine-tuning with only 3,000 pairs of data from the dictionary produces significant increases in accuracy compared to Bible-only models. We then show that simultaneously fine-tuning with dictionary and Bible data achieves a substantial increase over the accuracy of a dictionary-only trained translator, and similarly happens when using two-step methods of fine-tuning. However, we also observed some, measurable, contaminated text from the Bible into the outputs of the best translator, creating concerns about its release to an Indigenous community.

Despite their impressive performance, recent studies have shown that LLMs are vulnerable to deliberately crafted adversarial prompts even when aligned via Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback or supervised fine-tuning. While existing defense methods focus on either detecting harmful prompts or reducing the likelihood of harmful responses through various means, defending LLMs against jailbreak attacks based on the inner mechanisms of LLMs remains largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate how LLMs respond to harmful prompts and propose a novel defense method termed \textbf{L}ayer-specific \textbf{Ed}iting (LED) to enhance the resilience of LLMs against jailbreak attacks. Through LED, we reveal that several critical \textit{safety layers} exist among the early layers of LLMs. We then show that realigning these safety layers (and some selected additional layers) with the decoded safe response from identified \textit{toxic layers} can significantly improve the alignment of LLMs against jailbreak attacks. Extensive experiments across various LLMs (e.g., Llama2, Mistral) show the effectiveness of LED, which effectively defends against jailbreak attacks while maintaining performance on benign prompts.

The majority of existing toxicity metrics rely on encoder models trained on specific toxicity datasets, which are susceptible to out-of-distribution (OOD) problems and depend on the dataset`s definition of toxicity. In this paper, we introduce a robust metric grounded on LLMs to flexibly measure toxicity according to the given definition. We first analyze the toxicity factors, followed by an examination of the intrinsic toxic attributes of LLMs to ascertain their suitability as evaluators. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our metric with detailed analysis. Our empirical results demonstrate outstanding performance in measuring toxicity within verified factors, improving on conventional metrics by 12 points in the F1 score.

Patronizing and condescending language (PCL) is a form of speech directed at vulnerable groups. As an essential branch of toxic language, this type of language exacerbates conflicts and confrontations among Internet communities and detrimentally impacts disadvantaged groups. Traditional pre-trained language models (PLMs) perform poorly in detecting PCL due to its implicit toxicity traits like hypocrisy and false sympathy. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), we can harness their rich emotional semantics to establish a paradigm for exploring implicit toxicity. In this paper, we introduce PclGPT, a comprehensive LLM benchmark designed specifically for PCL. We collect, annotate, and integrate the Pcl-PT/SFT dataset, and then develop a bilingual PclGPT-EN/CN model group through a comprehensive pre-training and supervised fine-tuning staircase process to facilitate implicit toxic detection.

However, due to the black-box nature of GNNs, their outputs can be concerning in high-stakes decision-making scenarios, e.g., drug discovery. Facing such an issue, Graph Counterfactual Explanation (GCE) has emerged as a promising approach to improve GNN transparency. However, current GCE methods usually fail to take domain-specific knowledge into consideration, which can result in outputs that are not easily comprehensible by humans. To address this challenge, we propose a novel GCE method, LLM-GCE, to unleash the power of large language models (LLMs) in explaining GNNs for molecular property prediction. Specifically, we utilize an autoencoder to generate the counterfactual graph topology from a set of counterfactual text pairs (CTPs) based on an input graph.

However, these tasks are highly subjective and dependent on human factors, such as one`s environment, attitudes, beliefs, and lived experiences. Thus, it may be the case that employing LLMs (which do not have such human factors) in these tasks results in a lack of variation in data, failing to reflect the diversity of human experiences. In this paper, we examine the role of prompting LLMs with human-like personas and asking the models to answer as if they were a specific human. This is done explicitly, with exact demographics, political beliefs, and lived experiences, or implicitly via names prevalent in specific populations. The LLM personas are then evaluated via (1) subjective annotation task (e.g., detecting toxicity) and (2) a belief generation task, where both tasks are known to vary across human factors. We examine the impact of explicit vs. implicit personas and investigate which human factors LLMs recognize and respond to. Results show that explicit LLM personas show mixed results when reproducing known human biases, but generally fail to demonstrate implicit biases. We conclude that LLMs may capture the statistical patterns of how people speak, but are generally unable to model the complex interactions and subtleties of human perceptions, potentially limiting their effectiveness in social science applications.",,,,, ,  Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EMNLP 2024,

Prior work on compression typically prioritize preserving perplexity, which is directly analogous to training loss. The impact of compression method on other critical aspects of model behavior{---}particularly safety{---}requires systematic assessment. To this end, we investigate the impact of model compression along four dimensions: (1) degeneration harm, i.e., bias and toxicity in generation; (2) representational harm, i.e., biases in discriminative tasks; (3) dialect bias; and (4) language modeling and downstream task performance. We examine a wide spectrum of LLM compression techniques, including unstructured pruning, semi-structured pruning, and quantization. Our analysis reveals that compression can lead to unexpected consequences. Although compression may unintentionally alleviate LLMs' degeneration harm, it can still exacerbate representational harm. Furthermore, increasing compression produces a divergent impact on different protected groups. Finally, different compression methods have drastically different safety impacts: for example, quantization mostly preserves bias while pruning degrades quickly. Our findings underscore the importance of integrating safety assessments into the development of compressed LLMs to ensure their reliability across real-world applications.",,,,, ,  Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EMNLP 2024,

Furthermore, prevailing approaches to preference alignment primarily concentrate on pairwise comparisons, with limited exploration into multi-response scenarios, thereby overlooking the potential richness within the candidate pool. For the above reasons, we propose a new approach: Listwise Reward Enhancement for Preference Alignment (LIRE), a gradient-based reward optimization approach that incorporates the offline rewards of multiple responses into a streamlined listwise framework, thus eliminating the need for online sampling during training. LIRE is straightforward to implement, requiring minimal parameter tuning, and seamlessly aligns with the pairwise paradigm while naturally extending to multi-response scenarios.

Therefore, to further uncover the hidden possibilities of pre-training, we extract steering vectors from a LLM`s pre-training checkpoints to enhance the LLM`s trustworthiness.

DPO, as originally formulated, relies on binary preference data and fine-tunes a language model to increase the likelihood of a preferred response over a dispreferred response. However, not all preference pairs are equal. Sometimes, the preferred response is only slightly better than the dispreferred one. In other cases, the preference is much stronger. For instance, if a response contains harmful or toxic content, the annotator will have a strong preference for that response. In this paper, we propose a generalization of DPO, termed DPO with an offset (ODPO), that does not treat every preference pair equally during fine-tuning. Intuitively, ODPO requires the difference between the likelihood of the preferred and dispreferred response to be greater than an offset value. The offset is determined based on the extent to which one response is preferred over another.

Empirical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on six benchmarks, encompassing formality, toxicity, politics, politeness, authorship, and sentiment.",,,,, ,  Proceedings of the 2024 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,

In this paper, we present a thorough survey on the interpretation and analysis of in-context learning. First, we provide a concise introduction to the background and definition of in-context learning. Then, we give an overview of advancements from two perspectives: 1) a theoretical perspective, emphasizing studies on mechanistic interpretability and delving into the mathematical foundations behind ICL; and 2) an empirical perspective, concerning studies that empirically analyze factors associated with ICL. We conclude by discussing open questions and the challenges encountered, and suggesting potential avenues for future research.

In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of moral self-correction by answering three research questions: (1) In what scenarios does moral self-correction work? (2) What are the internal mechanisms of LLMs, e.g., hidden states, that are influenced by moral self-correction instructions? (3) Is intrinsic moral self-correction actually superficial in terms of reduced immorality in hidden states? We argue that self-correction can help LLMs find a shortcut to more morally correct output, rather than truly reducing the immorality stored in hidden states.Through empirical investigation with tasks of language generation and multi-choice question answering, we conclude: (i) LLMs exhibit good performance across both tasks, and self-correction instructions are particularly beneficial when the correct answer is already top-ranked; (ii) The morality levels in intermediate hidden states are strong indicators as to whether one instruction would be more effective than another; (iii) Based on our analysis of intermediate hidden states and task case studies of self-correction behaviors, we are first to propose the hypothesis that intrinsic moral self-correction is in fact superficial.",,,,, ,  Proceedings of the 2024 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,

We also study the utility of demographic information for rating prediction. NCF showed limited utility; however, integrating annotator history, demographics, and survey information permits both the embedding-based architecture and ICL to substantially improve prediction accuracy, with the embedding-based architecture outperforming the other methods. We also find that, if demographics are predicted from survey information, using these imputed demographics as features performs comparably to using true demographic data. This suggests that demographics may not provide substantial information for modeling ratings beyond what is captured in survey responses.

To this end, we carefully develop a large set of 2.58M instructions based on both existing and newly-generated instructions. In addition to being sizable, we design our instructions to cover a broad set of topics to ensure diversity. Extensive analysis of our instruction dataset confirms its diversity, and we generate responses for these instructions using gpt-3.5-turbo.

We evaluate the performance of our models using automatic metrics on 15 different natural language processing (NLP) benchmarks, as well as through human assessment.

In contrast, safe prompts lead to different gradient patterns. Building on this observation, GradSafe analyzes the gradients from prompts (paired with compliance responses) to accurately detect jailbreak prompts.

Through comparisons, we prove that the model exhibits information loss from the question over the shallow attention layers when generating rationales or answers. Based on the probing findings, we design a novel method called RIDERS (Residual decodIng and sERial-position Swap), which compensates for the information deficit in the model from both decoding and serial-position perspectives.

Nevertheless, due to data constraints, the capabilities of most open-source LLMs are primarily focused on English. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of $\textit{chat vector}$ to equip pre-trained language models with instruction following and human value alignment via simple model arithmetic. The chat vector is derived by subtracting the weights of a pre-trained base model (e.g. LLaMA2) from those of its corresponding chat model (e.g. LLaMA2-chat). By simply adding the chat vector to a continual pre-trained model`s weights, we can endow the model with chat capabilities in new languages without the need for further training.Our empirical studies demonstrate the superior efficacy of the chat vector from three different aspects: instruction following, toxicity mitigation, and multi-turn dialogue. Moreover, to showcase the adaptability of our approach, we extend our experiments to encompass various languages, base models, and chat vectors.

A key step in significance testing is the estimation of confidence interval which is a function of sample variance. Sample variance calculation is straightforward when evaluating against ground truth. However, in many cases, a metric model is often used for evaluation. For example, to compare toxicity of two large language models, a toxicity classifier is used for evaluation. Existing works usually do not consider the variance change due to metric model errors, which can lead to wrong conclusions. In this work, we establish the mathematical foundation of significance testing for model-based metrics. With experiments on public benchmark datasets and a production system, we show that considering metric model errors to calculate sample variances for model-based metrics changes the conclusions in certain experiments.",,,,, ,  Proceedings of the 2023 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,

Our findings suggest that research that relied on inherited automatic toxicity scores to compare models and techniques may have resulted in inaccurate findings. Rescoring all models from HELM, a widely respected living benchmark, for toxicity with the recent version of the API led to a different ranking of widely used foundation models.

In this paper, we introduce Reward-Augmented Decoding (RAD), a text generation procedure that uses a small unidirectional reward model to encourage a language model to generate text that has certain properties. Specifically, RAD uses the reward model to score generations as they are produced and rescales sampling probabilities to favor high-reward tokens. By using a unidirectional reward model, RAD can cache activations from prior generation steps to decrease computational overhead. Through experiments on generating non-toxic and sentiment-controlled text, we demonstrate that RAD performs best among methods that change only the generation procedure and matches the performance of state-of-the-art methods that involve re-training the language model. We further validate that RAD is effective on very large language models while incurring a minimal computational overhead.",,,,, ,  Proceedings of the 2023 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,

Concretely, we perform a controlled evaluation of zero-shot CoT across two socially sensitive domains: harmful questions and stereotype benchmarks. We find that zero-shot CoT reasoning in sensitive domains significantly increases a model`s likelihood to produce harmful or undesirable output, with trends holding across different prompt formats and model variants.

Healthy conversations are crucial for creating an inclusive environment and maintaining harmony in an organization. Toxic communications at the workplace can negatively impact overall job satisfaction and are often subtle, hidden, or demonstrate human biases. The linguistic subtlety of mild yet hurtful conversations has made it difficult for researchers to quantify and extract toxic conversations automatically. While offensive language or hate speech has been extensively studied in social communities, there has been little work studying toxic communication in emails. Specifically, the lack of corpus, sparsity of toxicity in enterprise emails, and well-defined criteria for annotating toxic conversations have prevented researchers from addressing the problem at scale. We take the first step towards studying toxicity in workplace emails by providing (1) a general and computationally viable taxonomy to study toxic language at the workplace (2) a dataset to study toxic language at the workplace based on the taxonomy and (3) analysis on why offensive language and hate-speech datasets are not suitable to detect workplace toxicity.",,,,, ,  Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EMNLP 2021,

It raises a new challenge on the logical-level content planning of table-to-text models. However, directly learning the logical inference knowledge from table-text pairs is very difficult for neural models because of the ambiguity of natural language and the scarcity of parallel data. Hence even large-scale pre-trained language models present low logical fidelity on logical table-to-text. In this work, we propose a Pretrained Logical Form Generator (PLOG) framework to improve generation fidelity. Specifically, PLOG is first pretrained on a table-to-logical-form generation (table-to-logic) task, then finetuned on downstream table-to-text tasks. The logical forms are formally defined with unambiguous semantics. Hence we can collect a large amount of accurate logical forms from tables without human annotation. In addition, PLOG can learn logical inference from table-logic pairs much more reliably than from table-text pairs. To evaluate our model, we further collect a controlled logical table-to-text dataset CONTLOG based on an existing dataset.

In this work, we focus on stylistic control and evaluation for schema-guided NLG, with joint goals of achieving both semantic and stylistic control. We experiment in detail with various controlled generation methods for large pretrained language models: specifically, conditional training, guided fine-tuning, and guided decoding. We discuss their advantages and limitations, and evaluate them with a broad range of automatic and human evaluation metrics. Our results show that while high style accuracy and semantic correctness are easier to achieve for more lexically-defined styles with conditional training, stylistic control is also achievable for more semantically complex styles using discriminator-based guided decoding methods. The results also suggest that methods that are more scalable (with less hyper-parameters tuning) and that disentangle context generation and stylistic variations are more effective at achieving semantic correctness and style accuracy.",,,,, ,  Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Conversational AI,

In this work, we present a new efficient approach, Ethos, that rectifies LMs to mitigate toxicity and bias in outputs and avoid privacy leakage. Ethos is built on task arithmetic. However, unlike current task arithmetic algorithms, Ethos distinguishes general beneficial and undesired knowledge when reconstructing task vectors. Specifically, Ethos first obtains a set of principal components from the pre-trained models using singular value decomposition. Then, by projecting the task vector onto principal components, Ethos separates the principal components that encode general from those associated with undesired knowledge. Ethos performs forgetting or unlearning by only negating the task vector with undesired knowledge, thereby minimizing collateral damage on general model utility. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on three different tasks: bias, toxicity, and memorization unlearning. Evaluations show Ethos is more effective in removing undesired knowledge while maintaining the overall model performance compared to current task arithmetic methods.",,,,, ,  Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: NAACL 2024,

We used such considerations to devise three criteria for our new protocol: Specification Polarity, Specification Importance, and Domain Transferability. As a case study, we apply our protocol to a popular debiasing method, Self-Debiasing, and compare it to one we propose, called Instructive Debiasing, and demonstrate that consistency is as important an aspect to debiasing viability as is simply a desirable result.

We develop a demonstration-based prompting framework and an adversarial classifier-in-the-loop decoding method to generate subtly toxic and benign text with a massive pretrained language model. Controlling machine generation in this way allows ToxiGen to cover implicitly toxic text at a larger scale, and about more demographic groups, than previous resources of human-written text.

Secondly, implementing safety features may compromise the quality of the conversation (trade-off challenge). To tackle the challenges, this paper introduces a regularized fine-tuning approach called FlatGD. By employing a safety-tailored loss, we translate better optimization to more safety.

Previous studies have shed light on the pitfalls of label aggregation and have introduced a handful of practical approaches to tackle this issue. Recently proposed multi-annotator models, which predict labels individually per annotator, are vulnerable to under-determination for annotators with few samples.

In light of this challenge, in this work, we study learning fair representations that satisfy a notion of fairness known as equalized odds for text classification via contrastive learning. Specifically, we first theoretically analyze the connections between learning representations with a fairness constraint and conditional supervised contrastive objectives, and then propose to use conditional supervised contrastive objectives to learn fair representations for text classification. We conduct experiments on two text datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches in balancing the trade-offs between task performance and bias mitigation among existing baselines for text classification.

In order to detect such toxic generations, existing methods rely on templates, real-world data extraction, crowdsourcing workers or automatic generation to construct adversarial contexts that are likely to induce toxic generations.

In this paper, we identify that context toxicity and context category (e.g., profanity, insult, drugs, etc.) are two important factors to cause safety issues in response generation. Hence, we propose a method called reverse generation to construct adversarial contexts conditioned on a given response, with the flexibility to control category, toxicity level and inductivity of the generated contexts. Via reverse generation, we augment the existing BAD dataset and construct a new dataset BAD+ which contains more than 120K diverse and highly inductive contexts in 12 categories. We test three popular pretrained dialogue models (Blender, DialoGPT and Plato2) and find that BAD+ can largely expose their safety problems.

Understanding the harms and offensiveness of statements requires reasoning about the social and situational context in which statements are made. For example, the utterance {\textquotedblleft}your English is very good{\textquotedblright} may implicitly signal an insult when uttered by a white man to a non-white colleague, but uttered by an ESL teacher to their student would be interpreted as a genuine compliment. Such contextual factors have been largely ignored by previous approaches to toxic language detection. We introduce COBRA frames, the first context-aware formalism for explaining the intents, reactions, and harms of offensive or biased statements grounded in their social and situational context. We create COBRACORPUS, a dataset of 33k potentially offensive statements paired with machine-generated contexts and free-text explanations of offensiveness, implied biases, speaker intents, and listener reactions. To study the contextual dynamics of offensiveness, we train models to generate COBRA explanations, with and without access to the context. We find that explanations by context-agnostic models are significantly worse than by context-aware ones, especially in situations where the context inverts the statement`s offensiveness (29{\%} accuracy drop).

We propose several novel approaches to pre-training translation models that involve different levels of lexical and structural knowledge, including: 1) generating obfuscated data from a large parallel corpus 2) concatenating phrase pairs extracted from a small word-aligned corpus, and 3) generating synthetic parallel data without real human language corpora. Our experiments on multiple language pairs reveal that pre-training benefits can be realized even with high levels of obfuscation or purely synthetic parallel data.

Thus, it is still an open question: shall we pretrain large autoregressive LMs with retrieval? To answer it, we perform a comprehensive study on a scalable pre-trained retrieval-augmented LM (i.e., RETRO) compared with standard GPT and retrieval-augmented GPT incorporated at fine-tuning or inference stages. We first provide the recipe to reproduce RETRO up to 9.5B parameters while retrieving a text corpus with 330B tokens. Based on that, we have the following novel findings: i) RETRO outperforms GPT on text generation with much less degeneration (i.e., repetition), moderately higher factual accuracy, and slightly lower toxicity with a nontoxic retrieval database. ii) On the LM Evaluation Harness benchmark, RETRO largely outperforms GPT on knowledge-intensive tasks, but is on par with GPT on other tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a simple variant of the model, RETRO++, which largely improves open-domain QA results of original RETRO (e.g., EM score +8.6 on Natural Question) and significantly outperforms retrieval-augmented GPT across different model sizes.

To study this problem, we paraphrase the prompts with different syntactic structures and use these to evaluate demographic bias in NLG systems. Our results suggest similar overall bias trends but some syntactic structures lead to contradictory conclusions compared to past works. We show that our methodology is more robust and that some syntactic structures prompt more toxic content while others could prompt less biased generation.

To address this gap, we propose a novel challenge of reasoning with circumstantial preconditions. We collect a dataset, called PaCo, consisting of 12.4 thousand preconditions of commonsense statements expressed in natural language. Based on this dataset, we create three canonical evaluation tasks and use them to examine the capability of existing LMs to understand situational preconditions. Our results reveal a 10-30{\%} gap between machine and human performance on our tasks, which shows that reasoning with preconditions is an open challenge.",,,,, ,  Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EMNLP 2022,

In this work, we make a substantial step towards unveiling this underlying prediction process, by reverse-engineering the operation of the feed-forward network (FFN) layers, one of the building blocks of transformer models. We view the token representation as a changing distribution over the vocabulary, and the output from each FFN layer as an additive update to that distribution. Then, we analyze the FFN updates in the vocabulary space, showing that each update can be decomposed to sub-updates corresponding to single FFN parameter vectors, each promoting concepts that are often human-interpretable. We then leverage these findings for controlling LM predictions, where we reduce the toxicity of GPT2 by almost 50{\%}, and for improving computation efficiency with a simple early exit rule, saving 20{\%} of computation on average.",,,,, ,  Proceedings of the 2022 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,

Specifically, it initializes the entire output sequence with noise and follows a Markov chain defined by Langevin Dynamics using the gradients of this energy.

To address this issue, we introduce ProsocialDialog, the first large-scale multi-turn dialogue dataset to teach conversational agents to respond to problematic content following social norms.

Created via a human-AI collaborative framework, ProsocialDialog consists of 58K dialogues, with 331K utterances, 160K unique RoTs, and 497K dialogue safety labels accompanied by free-form rationales.With this dataset, we introduce a dialogue safety detection module, Canary, capable of generating RoTs given conversational context, and a socially-informed dialogue agent, Prost. Empirical results show that Prost generates more socially acceptable dialogues compared to other state-of-the-art language and dialogue models in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings. Additionally, Canary effectively guides conversational agents and off-the-shelf language models to generate significantly more prosocial responses.

When trained on large, unfiltered crawls from the Internet, language models pick up and reproduce all kinds of undesirable biases that can be found in the data: They often generate racist, sexist, violent, or otherwise toxic language. As large models require millions of training examples to achieve good performance, it is difficult to completely prevent them from being exposed to such content. In this paper, we first demonstrate a surprising finding: Pretrained language models recognize, to a considerable degree, their undesirable biases and the toxicity of the content they produce. We refer to this capability as self-diagnosis. Based on this finding, we then propose a decoding algorithm that, given only a textual description of the undesired behavior, reduces the probability of a language model producing problematic text. We refer to this approach as self-debiasing. Self-debiasing does not rely on manually curated word lists, nor does it require any training data or changes to the model`s parameters. While we by no means eliminate the issue of language models generating biased text, we believe our approach to be an important step in this direction.1",,,,, ,  ,

In particular, several of them evaluate disparity in model performance between protected groups and advantaged groups in the test corpus. However, we argue that evaluating bias at the corpus level is not enough for understanding how biases are embedded in a model. In fact, a model with similar aggregated performance between different groups on the entire data may behave differently on instances in a local region. To analyze and detect such local bias, we propose LOGAN, a new bias detection technique based on clustering.
