7192,"Title:Audio-based Indonesia Toxic Language Classification using Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory

 Users are able to connect with one another via web-based internet technologies through social media platforms like Twitter. On these platforms, hate speech has become a troubling problem, when people or groups are targeted because of characteristics like color, ethnicity, gender, nationality, religion, or organization. Such information is spreading quickly as a result of the practice of using hate speech to gain fast notoriety. 80% of cybercrime prosecutions in Indonesia involve hate speech and defamation on social media, despite the fact that there are regulations like the UU ITE Law, Chapter 28, Number 2, that forbid inciting hatred or enmity on the basis of race, religion, or ethnicity. This research paper explores a novel approach to audio-based toxic language classification in the Indonesian language, leveraging key techniques including Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), speech recognition, and natural language processing. The study focuses on identifying toxic language using a balanced dataset of 5000 entries, equally divided between toxic and non-toxic categories. This dataset was compiled from diverse sources such as NusaCrowd, Kaggle, and others, and was subsequently cleansed of emojis and symbols to maintain a plain text environment. Utilizing audio-based content analysis, the methodology involved the transcription and classification of audio data, yielding an accuracy of 95.2%, precision of 96.4%, recall of 93.2% and F1 score of 94.8% in the detection of toxic speech. The implications of this research extend beyond the academic sphere of toxic language detection, holding significant real-world application potential in areas such as content moderation for Indonesian social media platforms and toxic language detection in customer service interactions. Thus, this study addresses a critical issue of toxic language proliferation in Indonesian online communities and social media platforms, further contributing to the development of healthier digital environments in the future.","Luckianto, Marvin, Addison, Renaldi, Vincent, Vincent, Muliono, Yohan, Prasetyo, Simeon Yuda",,,Audio-based Indonesia Toxic Language Classification using Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory,,,10.1109/ICORIS60118.2023.10352242 , ,2023,"Users are able to connect with one another via web-based internet technologies through social media platforms like Twitter.

 Many online social media platforms have particular community guidelines for comment sections. The platforms that maintain commentary sections in various posts, videos, and blogs need to adhere to these guidelines. These comment sections may have specific comments that fail to satisfy the rules and regulations to maintain societal norms of communication. These comments are classified as toxic comments. Google's Perspective API defines toxic comments as comments that are rude, offensive, and likely to make someone leave the conversation. In this paper, we have built a toxic words ontology, which is as per our knowledge, first Ontology built on toxic words. This Ontology consists of toxic words and their antonyms and synonyms in increasing order of their toxicity levels. Traversing this ontology, we can find the best-suited word with less toxicity and similar meaning. This is a dynamic ontology and new words can be added easily. Thus letting us convey messages in a civil manner. We propose to reduce toxicity in the most straightforward way. After studying several papers, we found out that the toxicity mainly occurs because of use of toxic words. We also observed that use of less toxic synonyms or no toxic synonyms has huge effects on toxicity score given by the Perspective API, and results section proves that.","Taru, Uma, Patil, Archana",,,Building Ontology for Toxic words,,,10.1109/MLCSS57186.2022.00052 , ,2022,"Many online social media platforms have particular community guidelines for comment sections.

7198,"Title:Bad Characters: Imperceptible NLP Attacks

 Several years of research have shown that machine-learning systems are vulnerable to adversarial examples, both in theory and in practice. Until now, such attacks have primarily targeted visual models, exploiting the gap between human and machine perception. Although text-based models have also been attacked with adversarial examples, such attacks struggled to preserve semantic meaning and indistinguishability. In this paper, we explore a large class of adversarial examples that can be used to attack text-based models in a black-box setting without making any human-perceptible visual modification to inputs. We use encoding-specific perturbations that are imperceptible to the human eye to manipulate the outputs of a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems from neural machine-translation pipelines to web search engines. We find that with a single imperceptible encoding injection – representing one invisible character, homoglyph, reordering, or deletion – an attacker can significantly reduce the performance of vulnerable models, and with three injections most models can be functionally broken. Our attacks work against currently-deployed commercial systems, including those produced by Microsoft and Google, in addition to open source models published by Facebook, IBM, and HuggingFace. This novel series of attacks presents a significant threat to many language processing systems: an attacker can affect systems in a targeted manner without any assumptions about the underlying model. We conclude that text-based NLP systems require careful input sanitization, just like conventional applications, and that given such systems are now being deployed rapidly at scale, the urgent attention of architects and operators is required.","Boucher, Nicholas, Shumailov, Ilia, Anderson, Ross, Papernot, Nicolas",,,Bad Characters: Imperceptible NLP Attacks,,,10.1109/SP46214.2022.9833641 , ,2022,"Several years of research have shown that machine-learning systems are vulnerable to adversarial examples, both in theory and in practice.

7199,"Title:Deep Learning Model for Identification and Classification of Web based Toxic Comments

 Everyday, many individuals face online trolling and receive hate on different social media platforms like Twitter, Instagram to name a few. Often these comments involving racial abuse, hate based on religion, caste are made by anonymous people over the internet, and it is quite a task to keep these comments under control. So, the objective was to develop a Machine Learning Model to help identify these comments. A Deep Learning Model (a sequential model) was made and it was trained to identify and classify a comment based on whether it is an apt comment or not. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is particularly well-suited for modeling sequential data, such as text. LSTMs are capable of modeling long-term dependencies in sequential data. In the case of text classification, this means that LSTMs can take into account the context of a word or phrase within a sentence, paragraph, or even an entire document. LSTMs can learn to selectively forget or remember information from the past, which is useful for filtering out noise or irrelevant information in text. LSTMs are well-established in the field of natural language processing (NLP) and have been shown to be effective for various NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis and text classification. Binary cross-entropy is a commonly used loss function in deep learning models for binary classification problems, such as predicting whether a comment is toxic or not. Binary cross-entropy is designed to optimize the model's predictions based on the binary nature of the classification task. It penalizes the model for assigning a low probability to the correct class and rewards it for assigning a high probability to the correct class. The loss function is differentiable, which allows gradient-based optimization methods to be used during training to minimize the loss and improve the model's performance. Binary cross-entropy is a well-established loss function that has been extensively used in the field of deep learning, and there are many tools and frameworks that support it, making it easy to implement in practice. Binary cross-entropy also has a probabilistic interpretation, which can be useful in some applications. For example, it can be used to estimate the probability that a given comment is toxic.

 Despite that deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved enormous success in many domains like natural language processing (NLP), they have also been proven to be vulnerable to maliciously generated adversarial examples.

Extensive experiments on two real-world tasks show that AdvGraph exhibits better performance compared with previous work: (i) effective – it significantly strengthens the model robustness even under the adaptive attacks setting without negative impact on model performance over legitimate input; (ii) generic – its key component, i.e., the representation of connotative adversarial knowledge is task-agnostic, which can be reused in any Chinese-based NLP models without retraining; and (iii) efficient – it is a light-weight defense with sub-linear computational complexity, which can guarantee the efficiency required in practical scenarios.","Li, Jinfeng, Du, Tianyu, Liu, Xiangyu, Zhang, Rong, Xue, Hui, Ji, Shouling",,,Enhancing Model Robustness by Incorporating Adversarial Knowledge into Semantic Representation,,,10.1109/ICASSP39728.2021.9414793 , ,2021,"Despite that deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved enormous success in many domains like natural language processing (NLP), they have also been proven to be vulnerable to maliciously generated adversarial examples.

 Drug-drug interactions are generally harmful.

Researchers and practitioners have been enthusiastically developing and extensively deploying textual content moderation software to address this problem. However, we find that malicious users can evade moderation by changing only a few words in the toxic content. Moreover, modern content moderation software's performance against malicious inputs remains underexplored. To this end, we propose MTTM, a Metamorphic Testing framework for Textual content Moderation software. Specifically, we conduct a pilot study on 2, 000 text messages collected from real users and summarize eleven metamorphic relations across three perturbation levels: character, word, and sentence. MTTM employs these metamorphic relations on toxic textual contents to generate test cases, which are still toxic yet likely to evade moderation. In our evaluation, we employ MTTM to test three commercial textual content moderation software and two state-of-the-art moderation algorithms against three kinds of toxic content. The results show that MTTM achieves up to 83.9%, 51%, and 82.5% error finding rates (EFR) when testing commercial moderation software provided by Google, Baidu, and Huawei, respectively, and it obtains up to 91.2% EFR when testing the state-of-the-art algorithms from the academy.

7219,"Title:The Problems, Language and Scientific Basis of Flammability Testing

 Flammability tests are intended to provide a measure of the fire hazard of a material or product. The gross factors involved are the ease of ignition, the rapidity of combustion development, the severity of conditions produced by the combustion (heat, smoke and toxic gas loads), and the performance of a product under a fire load. Most flammability tests have been developed by practical people under external pressures (legal or corporate) to produce a believable, reproducible test requiring a minimum of effort, equipment, and manpower. The scientific understanding of the tests is a luxury usually denied the designers. The resulting tests each measure some aspect of flammability, usually reproducible and well. However, because of thtlack of basic understanding, related tests measure different aspects of flammability and correlate poorly. There is a need for increased effort in understanding tests scientifically to aid in correlating and interpreting the results. A side result of this situation is that a jargon has developed which often obscures the usage and basis of the tests. This paper will document the chaotic state of flammability testing, define some of the specialized terms, and close with some suggestions for the scientific interpretation of some aspects of wire and cable testing as an example of the approach which the author feels would increase understanding in this field.","Fristrom, R.

 Hyperlipidemia is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular events, especially included cerebrovascular, coronary, and peripheral artery disease. Meanwhile, benzene is toxic at 500 parts per million and lethal at 20,000 parts per million for 5 to 10 minutes. Additionally, oral dosages ranging from 9 to 30 grams have been shown to be hazardous. Syzygium polyanthum also known as Syzygium polyanthum, is a Myrtaceae plant that is utilized in traditional medicine, due to its strong antioxidant activity. The objective of this research is to examine the antihyperlipidemia effect of Syzygium polyanthum ethanol extract on rats exposed to benzene. The result found that extract dropped cholesterol, triglyceride, and LDL levels and enhanced HDL levels at dosages of 400, 600, and 800 mg/kg BW, which were substantially different with p lower than 0.05 in the benzene induced group. Interestingly, the extract enhanced SOD levels and lowered MDA levels.

 In recent decades, the technology used to detect and quantify harmful algal blooms (commonly known as red tides) and characterize their physicochemical environment has improved considerably. A remaining challenge is effective delivery of the information generated from these advances in a user-friendly way to a diverse group of stakeholders. Based on existing infrastructure, we establish a Web-based system for near-real-time tracking of red tides caused by the toxic dinoflagellate Karenia brevis, which annually threatens human and environmental health in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. The system integrates different data products through a custom-made Web interface. Specifically, three types of data products are fused: 1) near-real-time ocean color imagery tailored for red tide monitoring; 2) K. brevis cell abundance determined by sample analysis; and 3) ocean currents from a nested and validated numerical model. These products are integrated and made available to users in Keyhole Markup Language (KML) format, which can be navigated, interpreted, and overlaid with other products in Google Earth. This integration provides users with the current status of red tide occurrence (e.g., location, severity, and spatial extent) while presenting a simple way to estimate bloom trajectory, thus delivering an effective method for near-real-time tracking of red tides.","Hu, Chuanmin, Murch, Brock, Corcoran, Alina A., Zheng, Lianyuan, Barnes, Brian B., Weisberg, Robert H., Atwood, Karen, Lenes, Jason M.",,,Developing a Smart Semantic Web With Linked Data and Models for Near-Real-Time Monitoring of Red Tides in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico,,,10.1109/JSYST.2015.2440782 , ,2016,"In recent decades, the technology used to detect and quantify harmful algal blooms (commonly known as red tides) and characterize their physicochemical environment has improved considerably.

 Deep learning is a potent method for locating and classifying harmful comments on social media and in online forums. Based on their text, comments are to be categorized as hazardous or non-toxic. Because they can manage enormous volumes of text input and comprehend the links between words and sentences, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as well as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are frequently used. The text data is transformed into numerical representations that retain the meaning of the words and phrases, such as word embeddings or sentence embeddings. These representations are then fed into a deep learning model that has been trained to distinguish between toxic and non-toxic comments using a labeled dataset of comments. The model modifies its parameters based on the discrepancy between its predictions and the actual labels during training. After training is finished, a different dataset is used to test the model's performance in identifying harmful remarks. It has been demonstrated that deep learning outperforms conventional machine learning methods in this job. However, given their potential to significantly affect the model's performance, elements including the caliber of the training data, the model architecture, and the selection of hyperparameters must be carefully taken into account.","Suresh, Shruti, Yadav, Bishwajit, Kumari, Srishti, Choudhary, Aakriti, Krishika, Rathod, R, Mahesh T",,,Performance Analysis of Comment Toxicity Detection Using Machine Learning,,,10.1109/CSET58993.2023.10346832 , ,2023,"Deep learning is a potent method for locating and classifying harmful comments on social media and in online forums.

7227,"Title:Toxicity Detection in Water Based on Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons Using Machine Learning Algorithms

 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are natural compounds having aromatic ring structures with carbon and hydrogen atoms. PAH can be found in our ecosystem such as air, water, soil, marine and in various food products. Excess presence of PAH is toxic to the environment and leads to carcinogenic effects on the organisms. Further, the presence of PAHs has been observed in aquatic systems which is the result of influent and effluent from wastewater treatment plants, seawater, surface water and ground water. Due to their high affinity and low solubility properties for particulates, PAH concentrations are less in water. However, the toxic nature of the water can be identified based on the concentration limit set by European standards and expert knowledge. Therefore, in this research it is proposed to detect the presence of toxicity in the water based on the PAHs. There are multiple methods to measure the PAH level like Gas chromatography /Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) and High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), but the detection of toxicity is through experimental analysis or expert knowledge. In this consideration, an investigative study has been conducted on the PAHs and the extracted feature sets were formed to evaluate through nonlinear machine learning algorithms such as Artificial Neural Networks.
