6441,"Title:Machine learning algorithms for outcome prediction in (chemo)radiotherapy: An empirical comparison of classifiers

 PurposeMachine learning classification algorithms (classifiers) for prediction of treatment response are becoming more popular in radiotherapy literature. General Machine learning literature provides evidence in favor of some classifier families (random forest, support vector machine, gradient boosting) in terms of classification performance. The purpose of this study is to compare such classifiers specifically for (chemo)radiotherapy datasets and to estimate their average discriminative performance for radiation treatment outcome prediction.MethodsWe collected 12 datasets (3496 patients) from prior studies on post-(chemo)radiotherapy toxicity, survival, or tumor control with clinical, dosimetric, or blood biomarker features from multiple institutions and for different tumor sites, that is, (non-)small-cell lung cancer, head and neck cancer, and meningioma. Six common classification algorithms with built-in feature selection (decision tree, random forest, neural network, support vector machine, elastic net logistic regression, LogitBoost) were applied on each dataset using the popular open-source R package caret. The R code and documentation for the analysis are available online (). All classifiers were run on each dataset in a 100-repeated nested fivefold cross-validation with hyperparameter tuning. Performance metrics (AUC, calibration slope and intercept, accuracy, Cohen's kappa, and Brier score) were computed. We ranked classifiers by AUC to determine which classifier is likely to also perform well in future studies. We simulated the benefit for potential investigators to select a certain classifier for a new dataset based on our study (pre-selection based on other datasets) or estimating the best classifier for a dataset (set-specific selection based on information from the new dataset) compared with uninformed classifier selection (random selection).ResultsRandom forest (best in 6/12 datasets) and elastic net logistic regression (best in 4/12 datasets) showed the overall best discrimination, but there was no single best classifier across datasets. Both classifiers had a median AUC rank of 2. Preselection and set-specific selection yielded a significant average AUC improvement of 0.02 and 0.02 over random selection with an average AUC rank improvement of 0.42 and 0.66, respectively.ConclusionRandom forest and elastic net logistic regression yield higher discriminative performance in (chemo)radiotherapy outcome and toxicity prediction than other studied classifiers. Thus, one of these two classifiers should be the first choice for investigators when building classification models or to benchmark one's own modeling results against. Our results also show that an informed preselection of classifiers based on existing datasets can improve discrimination over random selection.","Deist, Timo M.; Dankers, Frank J. W.

6442,"Title:Systematic Poisoning Attacks on and Defenses for Machine Learning in Healthcare

 Machine learning is being used in a wide range of application domains to discover patterns in large datasets. Increasingly, the results of machine learning drive critical decisions in applications related to healthcare and biomedicine. Such health-related applications are often sensitive, and thus, any security breach would be catastrophic. Naturally, the integrity of the results computed by machine learning is of great importance. Recent research has shown that some machine-learning algorithms can be compromised by augmenting their training datasets with malicious data, leading to a new class of attacks called poisoning attacks. Hindrance of a diagnosis may have life-threatening consequences and could cause distrust. On the other hand, not only may a false diagnosis prompt users to distrust the machine-learning algorithm and even abandon the entire system but also such a false positive classification may cause patient distress. In this paper, we present a systematic, algorithm-independent approach for mounting poisoning attacks across a wide range of machine-learning algorithms and healthcare datasets. The proposed attack procedure generates input data, which, when added to the training set, can either cause the results of machine learning to have targeted errors (e.g., increase the likelihood of classification into a specific class), or simply introduce arbitrary errors ( incorrect classification). These attacks may be applied to both fixed and evolving datasets. They can be applied even when only statistics of the training dataset are available or, in some cases, even without access to the training dataset, although at a lower efficacy.

The impact of AI models on marginalized com-
munities has traditionally been measured by
identifying performance differences between
specified demographic subgroups. Though this
approach aims to center vulnerable groups, it
risks obscuring patterns of harm faced by inter-
sectional subgroups or shared across multiple
groups. To address this, we draw on theories
of marginalization from disability studies and
related disciplines, which state that people far-
ther from the norm face greater adversity, to
consider the “margins” in the domain of toxic-
ity detection. We operationalize the “margins”
of a dataset by employing outlier detection to
identify text about people with demographic
attributes distant from the “norm”. We find that
model performance is consistently worse for
demographic outliers, with mean squared error
(MSE) between outliers and non-outliers up to
70.4% worse across toxicity types. It is also
worse for text outliers, with a MSE up to 68.4%
higher for outliers than non-outliers. We also
find text and demographic outliers to be partic-
ularly susceptible to errors in the classification
of severe toxicity and identity attacks. Com-
pared to analysis of disparities using traditional
demographic breakdowns, we find that our out-
lier analysis frequently surfaces greater harms
faced by a larger, more intersectional group,
which suggests that outlier analysis is partic-
ularly beneficial for identifying harms against
those groups.","Raman V,Fleisig E,Klein D",,,Centering the Margins: Outlier-Based Identification of Harmed Populations in Toxicity Detection,,, , Conference Paper,2023,"Eve Fleisig∗

 Abstract:Background: The existence of toxic conversations in open-source platforms can degrade relationships among software developers and may negatively impact software product quality. To help mitigate this, some initial work has been done to detect toxic comments in the Software Engineering (SE) domain. Aims: Since automatically classifying an entire text as toxic or non-toxic does not help human moderators to understand the specific reason(s) for toxicity, we worked to develop an explainable toxicity detector for the SE domain. Method: Our explainable toxicity detector can detect specific spans of toxic content from SE texts, which can help human moderators by automatically highlighting those spans. This toxic span detection model, ToxiSpanSE, is trained with the 19,651 code review (CR) comments with labeled toxic spans. Our annotators labeled the toxic spans within 3,757 toxic CR samples. We explored several types of models, including one lexicon-based approach and five different transformer-based encoders. Results: After an extensive evaluation of all models, we found that our fine-tuned RoBERTa model achieved the best score with 0.88 $F1$, 0.87 precision, and 0.93 recall for toxic class tokens, providing an explainable toxicity classifier for the SE domain.

 Algorithmic bias often arises as a result of differential subgroup validity, in which predictive relationships vary across groups. For example, in toxic language detection, comments targeting different demographic groups can vary markedly across groups. In such settings, trained models can be dominated by the relationships that best fit the majority group, leading to disparate performance. We propose framing toxicity detection as multi-task learning (MTL), allowing a model to specialize on the relationships that are relevant to each demographic group while also leveraging shared properties across groups. With toxicity detection, each task corresponds to identifying toxicity against a particular demographic group. However, traditional MTL requires labels for all tasks to be present for every data point. To address this, we propose Conditional MTL (CondMTL), wherein only training examples relevant to the given demographic group are considered by the loss function. This lets us learn group specific representations in each branch which are not cross contaminated by irrelevant labels. Results on synthetic and real data show that using CondMTL improves predictive recall over various baselines in general and for the minority demographic group in particular, while having similar overall accuracy.","Gupta S,Lee S,De-Arteaga M,Lease M",,,"Same Same, But Different: Conditional Multi-Task Learning for Demographic-Specific Toxicity Detection",,,10.1145/3543507.3583290 , Conference Paper,2023,"Algorithmic bias often arises as a result of differential subgroup validity, in which predictive relationships vary across groups.

6450,"Title:ToxVis: Enabling Interpretability of Implicit vs. Explicit Toxicity Detection Models with Interactive Visualization

 Abstract:The rise of hate speech on online platforms has led to an urgent need for effective content moderation. However, the subjective and multi-faceted nature of hateful online content, including implicit hate speech, poses significant challenges to human moderators and content moderation systems. To address this issue, we developed ToxVis, a visually interactive and explainable tool for classifying hate speech into three categories: implicit, explicit, and non-hateful. We fine-tuned two transformer-based models using RoBERTa, XLNET, and GPT-3 and used deep learning interpretation techniques to provide explanations for the classification results. ToxVis enables users to input potentially hateful text and receive a classification result along with a visual explanation of which words contributed most to the decision. By making the classification process explainable, ToxVis provides a valuable tool for understanding the nuances of hateful content and supporting more effective content moderation.

However, the subjective and multi-faceted nature of hateful online content, including implicit hate speech, poses significant challenges to human moderators and content moderation systems. To address this issue, we developed ToxVis, a visually interactive and explainable tool for classifying hate speech into three categories: implicit, explicit, and non-hateful. We fine-tuned two transformer-based models using RoBERTa, XLNET, and GPT-3 and used deep learning interpretation techniques to provide explanations for the classification results. ToxVis enables users to input potentially hateful text and receive a classification result along with a visual explanation of which words contributed most to the decision. By making the classification process explainable, ToxVis provides a valuable tool for understanding the nuances of hateful content and supporting more effective content moderation.

 Abstract:Toxicity is a prevalent social behavior that involves the use of hate speech, offensive language, bullying, and abusive speech. While text-based approaches for toxicity detection are common, there is limited research on processing speech signals in the physical world. Detecting toxicity in the physical world is challenging due to the difficulty of integrating AI-capable computers into the environment. We propose a lightweight transformer model based on wav2vec2.0 and optimize it using techniques such as quantization and knowledge distillation. Our model uses multitask learning and achieves an average macro F1-score of 90.3\% and a weighted accuracy of 88\%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on DeToxy-B and a public dataset. Our results show that quantization reduces the model size by almost 4 times and RAM usage by 3.3\%, with only a 1\% F1 score decrease. Knowledge distillation reduces the model size by 3.7 times, RAM usage by 1.9, and inference time by 2 times, but decreases accuracy by 8\%. Combining both techniques reduces the model size by 14.6 times and RAM usage by around 4.3 times, with a two-fold inference time improvement.

 Abstract:Large Language Models~(LLMs) drive current AI breakthroughs despite very little being known about their internal representations, e.g., how to extract a few informative features to solve various downstream tasks.

Our results are informative, do not rely on approximations, and are actionable. First, we show that, motivated by our geometric interpretation, we can bypass Llama$2$'s RLHF by controlling its embedding's intrinsic dimension through informed prompt manipulation. Second, we derive $7$ interpretable spline features that can be extracted from any (pre-trained) LLM layer, providing a rich abstract representation of their inputs.

 With the widespread use of toxic language online, platforms are increasingly using automated systems that leverage advances in natural language processing to automatically flag and remove toxic comments. However, most automated systems, when detecting and moderating toxic language, do not provide feedback to their users, let alone provide an avenue of recourse for these users to make actionable changes. We present our work, RECAST, an interactive, open-sourced web tool for visualizing these models' toxic predictions, while providing alternative suggestions for flagged toxic language. Our work also provides users with a new path of recourse when using these automated moderation tools. RECAST highlights text responsible for classifying toxicity, and allows users to interactively substitute potentially toxic phrases with neutral alternatives. We examined the effect of RECAST via two large-scale user evaluations, and found that RECAST was highly effective at helping users reduce toxicity as detected through the model. Users also gained a stronger understanding of the underlying toxicity criterion used by black-box models, enabling transparency and recourse. In addition, we found that when users focus on optimizing language for these models instead of their own judgement (which is the implied incentive and goal of deploying automated models), these models cease to be effective classifiers of toxicity compared to human annotations. This opens a discussion for how toxicity detection models work and should work, and their effect on the future of online discourse.","Wright AP,Shaikh O,Park H,Epperson W,Ahmed M,Pinel S,Chau DH,Yang D",,,RECAST: Enabling User Recourse and Interpretability of Toxicity Detection Models with Interactive Visualization,5,CSCW1,10.1145/3449280 , Journal Article,2021,"With the widespread use of toxic language online, platforms are increasingly using automated systems that leverage advances in natural language processing to automatically flag and remove toxic comments.

We examined the effect of RECAST via two large-scale user evaluations, and found that RECAST was highly effective at helping users reduce toxicity as detected through the model. Users also gained a stronger understanding of the underlying toxicity criterion used by black-box models, enabling transparency and recourse. In addition, we found that when users focus on optimizing language for these models instead of their own judgement (which is the implied incentive and goal of deploying automated models), these models cease to be effective classifiers of toxicity compared to human annotations. This opens a discussion for how toxicity detection models work and should work, and their effect on the future of online discourse.",,,,, Proc. ACM Hum. Comput. Interact.,  ,,detection#methodology,
6465,"Title:Toxicity Detection in Online Comments with Limited Data: A Comparative Analysis

 Comment sections of online news platforms are an essential space
to express opinions and discuss political topics. In contrast to other online
posts, news discussions are related to particular news articles, comments re-
fer to each other, and individual conversations emerge. However, the misuse
by spammers, haters, and trolls makes costly content moderation necessary.
Sentiment analysis can not only support moderation but also help to under-
stand the dynamics of online discussions. A subtask of content moderation
is the identiﬁcation of toxic comments. To this end, we describe the con-
cept of toxicity and characterize its subclasses. Further, we present various
deep learning approaches, including datasets and architectures, tailored to
sentiment analysis in online discussions. One way to make these approaches
more comprehensible and trustworthy is ﬁne-grained instead of binary com-
ment classiﬁcation. On the downside, more classes require more training data.
Therefore, we propose to augment training data by using transfer learning.
We discuss real-world applications, such as semi-automated comment mod-
eration and troll detection. Finally, we outline future challenges and current
limitations in the light of most recent research publications.

 AbstractOnline social media platforms increasingly rely on Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to detect abusive content at scale in order to mitigate the harms it causes to their users. However, these techniques suffer from various sampling and association biases present in training data, often resulting in sub-par performance on content relevant to marginalized groups, potentially furthering disproportionate harms towards them. Studies on such biases so far have focused on only a handful of axes of disparities and subgroups that have annotations/lexicons available. Consequently, biases concerning non-Western contexts are largely ignored in the literature. In this paper, we introduce a weakly supervised method to robustly detect lexical biases in broader geo-cultural contexts. Through a case study on a publicly available toxicity detection model, we demonstrate that our method identifies salient groups of cross-geographic errors, and, in a follow up, demonstrate that these groupings reflect human judgments of offensive and inoffensive language in those geographic contexts. We also conduct analysis of a model trained on a dataset with ground truth labels to better understand these biases, and present preliminary mitigation experiments.","Ghosh S,Baker DK,Jurgens D,Prabhakaran V",,,Cross-geographic Bias Detection in Toxicity Modeling,abs/2104.06999,, , Journal Article,2021,"AbstractOnline social media platforms increasingly rely on Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to detect abusive content at scale in order to mitigate the harms it causes to their users.

 Abstract:User posts whose perceived toxicity depends on the conversational context are rare in current toxicity detection datasets. Hence, toxicity detectors trained on existing datasets will also tend to disregard context, making the detection of context-sensitive toxicity harder when it does occur. We construct and publicly release a dataset of 10,000 posts with two kinds of toxicity labels: (i) annotators considered each post with the previous one as context; and (ii) annotators had no additional context. Based on this, we introduce a new task, context sensitivity estimation, which aims to identify posts whose perceived toxicity changes if the context (previous post) is also considered. We then evaluate machine learning systems on this task, showing that classifiers of practical quality can be developed, and we show that data augmentation with knowledge distillation can improve the performance further.

 Abstract
        
      


      
      With the unprecedented deterioration of environmental quality, rapid recognition of toxic compounds is paramount for performing in situ real-time monitoring. Although several analytical techniques based on electrochemistry or biosensors have been developed for the detection of toxic compounds, most of them are time-consuming, inaccurate, or cumbersome for practical applications. More recently, microbial fuel cell (MFC)-based biosensors have drawn increasing interest due to their sustainability and cost-effectiveness, with applications ranging from the monitoring of anaerobic digestion process parameters (VFA) to water quality detection (e.g., COD, BOD). When a MFC runs under correct conditions, the voltage generated is correlated with the amount of a given substrate. Based on this linear relationship, several studies have demonstrated that MFC-based biosensors could detect heavy metals such as copper, chromium, or zinc, as well as organic compounds, including p-nitrophenol (PNP), formaldehyde and levofloxacin. Both bacterial consortia and single strains can be used to develop MFC-based biosensors. Biosensors with single strains show several advantages over systems integrating bacterial consortia, such as selectivity and stability. One of the limitations of such sensors is that the detection range usually exceeds the actual pollution level. Therefore, improving their sensitivity is the most important for widespread application. Nonetheless, MFC-based biosensors represent a promising approach towards single pollutant detection.

 This article is from Sensors (Basel, Switzerland), volume 13.AbstractA flow biosensor for the detection of toxicity in water using the ammonia-oxidizing bacterium (AOB) Nitrosomonas europaea as a bioreceptor and a polymeric membrane ammonium-selective electrode as a transducer is described. The system is based on the inhibition effects of toxicants on the activity of AOB, which can be evaluated by measuring the ammonium consumption rates with the ammonium-selective membrane electrode. The AOB cells are immobilized on polyethersulfone membranes packed in a holder, while the membrane electrode is placed downstream in the flow cell.

 Abstract
        
      


      
      It is well known that the electronic nose can be used to identify differences between human health and disease for a range of disorders. We present a pilot study to investigate if the electronic nose and a newer technology, FAIMS (Field Asymmetric Ion Mobility Spectrometry), can be used to identify and help inform the treatment pathway for patients receiving pelvic radiotherapy, which frequently causes gastrointestinal side-effects, severe in some. From a larger group, 23 radiotherapy patients were selected where half had the highest levels of toxicity and the others the lowest. Stool samples were obtained before and four weeks after radiotherapy and the volatiles and gases emitted analysed by both methods; these chemicals are products of fermentation caused by gut microflora. Principal component analysis of the electronic nose data and wavelet transform followed by Fisher discriminant analysis of FAIMS data indicated that it was possible to separate patients after treatment by their toxicity levels. More interestingly, differences were also identified in their pre-treatment samples. We believe these patterns arise from differences in gut microflora where some combinations of bacteria result to give this olfactory signature. In the future our approach may result in a technique that will help identify patients at ""high risk"" even before radiation treatment is started.","Covington JA,Wedlake L,Andreyev J,Ouaret N,Thomas MG,Nwokolo CU,Bardhan KD,Arasaradnam RP",,,The Detection of Patients at Risk of Gastrointestinal Toxicity during Pelvic Radiotherapy by Electronic Nose and FAIMS: A Pilot Study,12,10,10.3390/S121013002 , Journal Article,2012,"Abstract

 In this work we show the effectiveness of 2D structural fingerprints in the prediction of aquatic toxicity of chemical compounds, creating a self-contained system for structure-based aquatic toxicity classification.

 ABSTRACT
Biological early warning systems(BEWS) for toxicity detection is developed. BEWS detect toxicity by tracking actions of the whole creatures in aqua.Collected data have created some noise, and therefore can decrease the performance of prediction. In the paper,a noise reduction is scheme is devised to improve the performance of the prediction. The experiment result shows the decreased error rate by the new method, and is far better than that of the former BEWS system.

6482,"Title:Computational chemistry approach for the early detection of drug-induced idiosyncratic liver toxicity

 Idiosyncratic drug toxicity (IDT), considered as a toxic host‐dependent event, with an apparent lack of dose response relationship, is usually not predictable from early phases of clinical trials, representing a particularly confounding complication in drug development. Albeit a rare event (usually &lt;1/5000), IDT is often life threatening and is one of the major reasons new drugs never reach the market or are withdrawn post marketing. Computational methodologies, like the computer‐based approach proposed in the present study, can play an important role in addressing IDT in early drug discovery. We report for the first time a systematic evaluation of classification models to predict idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA), artificial neural networks (ANN), and machine learning algorithms (OneR) in conjunction with a 3D molecular structure representation and feature selection methods. These modeling techniques (LDA, feature selection to prevent over‐fitting and multicollinearity, ANN to capture nonlinear relationships in the data, as well as the simple OneR classifier) were found to produce QSTR models with satisfactory internal cross‐validation statistics and predictivity on an external subset of chemicals. More specifically, the models reached values of accuracy/sensitivity/specificity over 84%/78%/90%, respectively in the training series along with predictivity values ranging from <jats:italic>ca.</jats:italic> 78 to 86% of correctly classified drugs. An LDA‐based desirability analysis was carried out in order to select the levels of the predictor variables needed to trigger the more desirable drug, i.e. the drug with lower potential for idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity. Finally, two external test sets were used to evaluate the ability of the models in discriminating toxic from nontoxic structurally and pharmacologically related drugs and the ability of the best model (LDA) in detecting potential idiosyncratic hepatotoxic drugs, respectively.

 Abstract:The popularity of pretrained language models in natural language processing systems calls for a careful evaluation of such models in down-stream tasks, which have a higher potential for societal impact. The evaluation of such systems usually focuses on accuracy measures. Our findings in this paper call for attention to be paid to fairness measures as well. Through the analysis of more than a dozen pretrained language models of varying sizes on two toxic text classification tasks (English), we demonstrate that focusing on accuracy measures alone can lead to models with wide variation in fairness characteristics. Specifically, we observe that fairness can vary even more than accuracy with increasing training data size and different random initializations. At the same time, we find that little of the fairness variation is explained by model size, despite claims in the literature. To improve model fairness without retraining, we show that two post-processing methods developed for structured, tabular data can be successfully applied to a range of pretrained language models.

At the same time, we find that little of the fairness variation is explained by model size, despite claims in the literature. To improve model fairness without retraining, we show that two post-processing methods developed for structured, tabular data can be successfully applied to a range of pretrained language models.

 Abstract:Previous works on the fairness of toxic language classifiers compare the output of models with different identity terms as input features but do not consider the impact of other important concepts present in the context. Here, besides identity terms, we take into account high-level latent features learned by the classifier and investigate the interaction between these features and identity terms. For a multi-class toxic language classifier, we leverage a concept-based explanation framework to calculate the sensitivity of the model to the concept of sentiment, which has been used before as a salient feature for toxic language detection. Our results show that although for some classes, the classifier has learned the sentiment information as expected, this information is outweighed by the influence of identity terms as input features. This work is a step towards evaluating procedural fairness, where unfair processes lead to unfair outcomes. The produced knowledge can guide debiasing techniques to ensure that important concepts besides identity terms are well-represented in training datasets.","Nejadgholi I,Balkir E,Fraser KC,Kiritchenko S",,,Towards Procedural Fairness: Uncovering Biases in How a Toxic Language Classifier Uses Sentiment Information,,,10.18653/V1/2022.BLACKBOXNLP-1.18 , Conference Paper,2022,"Abstract:Previous works on the fairness of toxic language classifiers compare the output of models with different identity terms as input features but do not consider the impact of other important concepts present in the context.

 Abstract


Our world is more connected than ever before. Sadly, however, this highly connected world has made it easier to bully, insult, and propagate hate speech on the cyberspace. Even though researchers and companies alike have started investigating this real-world problem, the question remains as to why users are increasingly being exposed to hate and discrimination online. In fact, the noticeable and persistent increase in harmful language on social media platforms indicates that the situation is, actually, only getting worse. Hence, in this work, we show that contemporary ML methods can help tackle this challenge in an accurate and cost-effective manner. Our experiments demonstrate that a universal approach combining transfer learning methods and state-of-the-art Transformer architectures can trigger the efficient development of toxic language detection models. Consequently, with this universal approach, we provide platform providers with a simplistic approach capable of enabling the automated moderation of user-generated content, and as a result, hope to contribute to making the web a safer place.","Caron M,Bäumer FS,Müller O",,,Towards Automated Moderation: Enabling Toxic Language Detection with Transfer Learning and Attention-Based Models,,, , Conference Paper,2022,"Abstract

 Abstract:Toxicity on the Internet, such as hate speech, offenses towards particular users or groups of people, or the use of obscene words, is an acknowledged problem. However, there also exist other types of inappropriate messages which are usually not viewed as toxic, e.g. as they do not contain explicit offences.

Such messages are often related to particular sensitive topics, e.g. on politics, sexual minorities, social injustice which more often than other topics, e.g. cars or computing, yield toxic emotional reactions. At the same time, clearly not all messages within such flammable topics are inappropriate.
Towards this end, in this work, we present two text collections labelled according to binary notion of inapropriateness and a multinomial notion of sensitive topic.

 Abstract:Objective: Clinical knowledge enriched transformer models (e.g., ClinicalBERT) have state-of-the-art results on clinical NLP (natural language processing) tasks. One of the core limitations of these transformer models is the substantial memory consumption due to their full self-attention mechanism, which leads to the performance degradation in long clinical texts. To overcome this, we propose to leverage long-sequence transformer models (e.g., Longformer and BigBird), which extend the maximum input sequence length from 512 to 4096, to enhance the ability to model long-term dependencies in long clinical texts.
Materials and Methods: Inspired by the success of long sequence transformer models and the fact that clinical notes are mostly long, we introduce two domain enriched language models, Clinical-Longformer and Clinical-BigBird, which are pre-trained on a large-scale clinical corpus. We evaluate both language models using 10 baseline tasks including named entity recognition, question answering, natural language inference, and document classification tasks.
Results: The results demonstrate that Clinical-Longformer and Clinical-BigBird consistently and significantly outperform ClinicalBERT and other short-sequence transformers in all 10 downstream tasks and achieve new state-of-the-art results.

 AbstractThe popularity of pretrained language models in natural language processing systems calls for a careful evaluation of such models in down-stream tasks, which have a higher potential for societal impact. The evaluation of such systems usually focuses on accuracy measures. Our findings in this paper call for attention to be paid to fairness measures as well. Through the analysis of more than a dozen pretrained language models of varying sizes on two toxic text classification tasks (English), we demonstrate that focusing on accuracy measures alone can lead to models with wide variation in fairness characteristics. Specifically, we observe that fairness can vary even more than accuracy with increasing training data size and different random initializations.

The evaluation of such systems usually focuses on accuracy measures. Our findings in this paper call for attention to be paid to fairness measures as well. Through the analysis of more than a dozen pretrained language models of varying sizes on two toxic text classification tasks (English), we demonstrate that focusing on accuracy measures alone can lead to models with wide variation in fairness characteristics. Specifically, we observe that fairness can vary even more than accuracy with increasing training data size and different random initializations.

 Abstract:Large pre-trained language models are often trained on large volumes of internet data, some of which may contain toxic or abusive language. Consequently, language models encode toxic information, which makes the real-world usage of these language models limited. Current methods aim to prevent toxic features from appearing generated text. We hypothesize the existence of a low-dimensional toxic subspace in the latent space of pre-trained language models, the existence of which suggests that toxic features follow some underlying pattern and are thus removable. To construct this toxic subspace, we propose a method to generalize toxic directions in the latent space. We also provide a methodology for constructing parallel datasets using a context based word masking system. Through our experiments, we show that when the toxic subspace is removed from a set of sentence representations, almost no toxic representations remain in the result. We demonstrate empirically that the subspace found using our method generalizes to multiple toxicity corpora, indicating the existence of a low-dimensional toxic subspace.","Wang A,Sudhakar M,Ji Y",,,Simple Text Detoxification by Identifying a Linear Toxic Subspace in Language Model Embeddings,abs/2112.08346,, , Journal Article,2021,"Abstract:Large pre-trained language models are often trained on large volumes of internet data, some of which may contain toxic or abusive language.

 Abstract:Pretrained neural language models (LMs) are prone to generating racist, sexist, or otherwise toxic language which hinders their safe deployment. We investigate the extent to which pretrained LMs can be prompted to generate toxic language, and the effectiveness of controllable text generation algorithms at preventing such toxic degeneration. We create and release RealToxicityPrompts, a dataset of 100K naturally occurring, sentence-level prompts derived from a large corpus of English web text, paired with toxicity scores from a widely-used toxicity classifier. Using RealToxicityPrompts, we find that pretrained LMs can degenerate into toxic text even from seemingly innocuous prompts. We empirically assess several controllable generation methods, and find that while data- or compute-intensive methods (e.g., adaptive pretraining on non-toxic data) are more effective at steering away from toxicity than simpler solutions (e.g., banning ""bad"" words), no current method is failsafe against neural toxic degeneration. To pinpoint the potential cause of such persistent toxic degeneration, we analyze two web text corpora used to pretrain several LMs (including GPT-2; Radford et. al, 2019), and find a significant amount of offensive, factually unreliable, and otherwise toxic content.

 Abstract:Lack of moderation in online communities enables participants to incur in personal aggression, harassment or cyberbullying, issues that have been accentuated by extremist radicalisation in the contemporary post-truth politics scenario.

Recently Google has developed a machine-learning-based toxicity model in an attempt to assess the hostility of a comment; unfortunately, it has been suggested that said model can be deceived by adversarial attacks that manipulate the text sequence of the comment.

Then, we propose a two--stage approach to counter--attack these anomalies, bulding upon a recently proposed text deobfuscation method and the toxicity scoring model. Lastly, we conducted an experiment with approximately 24000 distorted comments, showing how in this way it is feasible to restore toxicity of the adversarial variants, while incurring roughly on a twofold increase in processing time.

6514,"Title:Notoriously Toxic: The Language and Cost of Hate in the Chat Systems of Online Games

 'Notoriously Toxic' presents a preliminary study of the language and impact of hate speech in the chat systems of online games.  Developed by a group of researchers in game studies, computational linguistics, sociolinguistics, and law and guided by an overall tripartite feedback model broadly corresponding to shielding potential victims from harm, educating those who casually engage in hate speech, and censuring those who persist in abusing their fellow players, the hope is that research-driven technical and social interventions might slowly shift online discourse norms away from casual, vicious, and potentially dangerous speech.  Identification at scale of textual expressions of toxic behavior in online environments is a necessary, empirical preliminary aspect of this work to understand the prevalence and cost of online hate, as is qualitative cultural studies of the games and their player populations. A recent example of qualitative framing work in this area was the 'Mapping Study on Projects Against Hate Speech Online' released in 2012 by the British Institute of Human Rights for the Council of Europe project, Young People Combating Hate Speech in Cyberspace (The British Institute of Human Rights Council, 2012). That report provides terminology and an environmental scan of processes aimed to limit hate speech online and offers suggestions as to new procedures.  It, along with an examination of the reporting systems implemented across a host of online games, computational modeling of the language prevalent in these chat systems, and a study of work in the political sphere to defuse hate speech prior to its catalyzation of violence, serve as the foundation for this research. Recent inquiries into the toxic elements of gaming cultures have primarily focused on communication outside of a game environment. For example, critical discourse analyses of player posts to online gaming forums found that heteronormative undertones of the World of Warcraft player community creates a culture of hostility toward LGBTQ communities (Pulos, 2013) and the same forum's  adamant disavowal of feminism have made community conversations about gender roles and/or equality all but non-existent (Braithwaite, 2013). Similarly, Gray's (2012a; 2012b; 2012c) ethnography of Xbox Live demonstrates the constant barrage of gender and racially motivated harassment faced by women of color who opt to communicate with teammates via voice chat.  Finally, community leaders' adamant position of gender based harassment being a 'non-issue' is summarized by Salter and Blodgett (2012), whose case study of Penny Arcade's (a popular webcomic and organizers of PAX, a successful annual gaming convention) dismissal of its responsibility in perpetuating rape culture and SXSW Interactive's recent declaration that conversations about harassment in the games space can by definition not be civil (Sinders, 2015) is indicative of an industry that is highly resistant to change unless external pressure is applied.  Taken together, this scholarship is evidence that toxicity exists across gaming culture writ large, and is not isolated to a particular game or specific player community. Studying this phenomena at webscale and in the ephemeral environments of multilingual online chat systems is complex and requires a multidisciplinary approach bridging core strengths in the humanities, such as cultural criticism, with strengths in social psychology, the data sciences, and linguistics.  Studying the socially destructive behavior as manifested in online gaming platforms encourages innovative approaches to this problem.  One corpus examined as part of this research is comprised of the chat logs produced by the player base in Riot Games' League of Legends (League).  As of January 2014, League had ~27 million unique players every day each playing no less than 20 minutes and a peak concurrency of 7.5 million people who collectively have logged billions of hours of total play time for the game since 2009 (Sherr, 2014). Given that the game is a global phenomenon, the chat logs contain harassment in virtually every language. Based on the UN framework provided in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1976), Susan Benesch generally defines hate speech as '. . . an expression that denigrates or stigmatizes a person or people based on their membership of a group that is usually but not always immutable, such as an ethnic or religious group. . . . Speech may express or foment hatred on the basis of any defining feature of a minority or indigenous people, such as ethnicity or religion – and can also denigrate people for another “failing“, such as their gender or even their location, as in the case of migrants' (Benesch, 2014, pp. 20). This broad but inclusive definition is further elaborated upon by Nazila Ghanea in reference to the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD) in the establishment of a spectrum from least to greatest: discriminatory speech, hate speech, incitement to hatred, incitement to terrorism, and incitement to genocide (Ghanea, 2013, pp. 940-1). The characteristics of these definitions reflect the significant impact that hate speech acts have on the establishment and enforcement of personal and communal identity and the need to identify such acts in order to preserve those identities. In his discussion on Carey's ritual model of communication as applied to cases of hate speech, Clay Calvert explains how hate speech initializes and perpetuates the subordination of one group over another (Calvert, 1997). Calvert notes that hate speech acts, specifically focusing on the repeated utilization of racial epithets, construct reality in the speaker, audience, and target members of the discourse through the creation and maintenance of mental schemata similar to the functions of other speech acts: 'In particular, racist speech helps to define who minorities are and how others think about minorities, facilitating their unequal treatment' (Calvert, 1997, pp. 12). This construction is harmful in its immediacy to the target as well as in the long-term situation as it perpetuates unequal power structures based on criteria of identity (Calvert, 1997, pp. 15-16). The construction of reality based on hate speech acts is also relevant to a discussion of online environments as the textual communication serves as a large social aspect of both on- and offline environments. Toxicity consists of verbal expressions and behaviors that serve to destabilize groups.  It is unclear whether toxic behavior is directed to elicit particular responses, and hence systemic, or reactionary, emotional, and hence, situational.  Frequently, the term 'troll,' or 'trolling,' is used synonymously with toxicity.  Regardless, these behaviors are necessary to address because they are a key factor in the outright hostility of online gaming environments to those perceived as other.  This destabilization maps on to offline models of gender, race, class, ethnic, national, linguistic, and abelist-based hate speech. A fertile ground for this analysis is in the virtual worlds of online gaming. For example, Kou and Nardi (2013), in their research on League of Legends, found that antisocial behavior destabilizes online communities but is addressable by social code and regulatory systems. The targeted examples in online gaming environments show a concentrated sample of toxic behavior that is pervasive in every online environment.  Studies have documented antisocial behavior and toxic speech in most digital platforms (O'Sullivan & Flanagin, 2003).  Whether considering flaming on 1980s and 90s USENET forums, social media fueled outrage on contemporary politics, or in-game, text-based conversation in multiplayer games, toxicity can be motivated by emotional, intellectual, political, or other causes and as such correlates strongly with the modes and consequences of offline hate speech.  Understanding online toxic behavior in ways that allow for moderation of its causes and effects first requires an understanding of how to study the concrete manifestation of this behavior—the text produced by users of a system.  The challenges faced by this research are many: the writing styles are heavily infused with jargon, the orthography is non-standard, the chat stream only represents one channel of communication, and the communities are fluid. In response to these challenges, an approach grounded in machine learning and NLP was tested.  Using a small subset of the available data, a classifier based upon developed to separate players toxic from non-toxic players yielded a precision of 0.77, a recall of 0.79 and an F-score of 0.78.  These results are encouraging, and along with training on a larger data set, secondary factors such as player avatar gender, length of match, and others were also preliminarily tested and found to have small influencing effects.  These results suggest that there are concrete, detectable semantic and syntactic patterns in the harassment levied at players in these games.  Connecting these findings to mechanisms for shielding, reforming, and censuring players, and to frameworks for understanding the social and psychological costs of being effectively locked in a room with one or more individuals determined to verbally abuse a peer is the more complex task of the cultural and ethnographic studies of digital communities.","Miller B,van den Bosch A,Kunzelman C,Olive J,Stoop W,Gray K,Berger C,Pokharel S",,,Notoriously Toxic: The Language and Cost of Hate in the Chat Systems of Online Games,,, , Conference Paper,2016,"'Notoriously Toxic' presents a preliminary study of the language and impact of hate speech in the chat systems of online games.

It is unclear whether toxic behavior is directed to elicit particular responses, and hence systemic, or reactionary, emotional, and hence, situational.  Frequently, the term 'troll,' or 'trolling,' is used synonymously with toxicity.  Regardless, these behaviors are necessary to address because they are a key factor in the outright hostility of online gaming environments to those perceived as other.  This destabilization maps on to offline models of gender, race, class, ethnic, national, linguistic, and abelist-based hate speech. A fertile ground for this analysis is in the virtual worlds of online gaming. For example, Kou and Nardi (2013), in their research on League of Legends, found that antisocial behavior destabilizes online communities but is addressable by social code and regulatory systems. The targeted examples in online gaming environments show a concentrated sample of toxic behavior that is pervasive in every online environment.  Studies have documented antisocial behavior and toxic speech in most digital platforms (O'Sullivan & Flanagin, 2003).  Whether considering flaming on 1980s and 90s USENET forums, social media fueled outrage on contemporary politics, or in-game, text-based conversation in multiplayer games, toxicity can be motivated by emotional, intellectual, political, or other causes and as such correlates strongly with the modes and consequences of offline hate speech.  Understanding online toxic behavior in ways that allow for moderation of its causes and effects first requires an understanding of how to study the concrete manifestation of this behavior—the text produced by users of a system.  The challenges faced by this research are many: the writing styles are heavily infused with jargon, the orthography is non-standard, the chat stream only represents one channel of communication, and the communities are fluid. In response to these challenges, an approach grounded in machine learning and NLP was tested.  Using a small subset of the available data, a classifier based upon developed to separate players toxic from non-toxic players yielded a precision of 0.77, a recall of 0.79 and an F-score of 0.78.  These results are encouraging, and along with training on a larger data set, secondary factors such as player avatar gender, length of match, and others were also preliminarily tested and found to have small influencing effects.  These results suggest that there are concrete, detectable semantic and syntactic patterns in the harassment levied at players in these games.  Connecting these findings to mechanisms for shielding, reforming, and censuring players, and to frameworks for understanding the social and psychological costs of being effectively locked in a room with one or more individuals determined to verbally abuse a peer is the more complex task of the cultural and ethnographic studies of digital communities.",,,,,Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations (ADHO) ,"11th Annual International Conference of the Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations, DH 2016, Krakow, Poland, July 11-16, 2016, Conference Abstracts  ",,evaluation#methodology,

 Abstract:Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) tuned on machine-generated instruction-following data have demonstrated remarkable performance in various multi-modal understanding and generation tasks. However, the hallucinations inherent in machine-generated data, which could lead to hallucinatory outputs in MLLMs, remain under-explored. This work aims to investigate various hallucinations (i.e., object, relation, attribute hallucinations) and mitigate those hallucinatory toxicities in large-scale machine-generated visual instruction datasets. Drawing on the human ability to identify factual errors, we present a novel hallucination detection and elimination framework, HalluciDoctor, based on the cross-checking paradigm. We use our framework to identify and eliminate hallucinations in the training data automatically. Interestingly, HalluciDoctor also indicates that spurious correlations arising from long-tail object co-occurrences contribute to hallucinations. Based on that, we execute counterfactual visual instruction expansion to balance data distribution, thereby enhancing MLLMs' resistance to hallucinations.

 Algorithmically generated personas can help organizations understand their social media audiences. However, when using algorithms to create personas from social media user data, the resulting personas may contain toxic quotes that negatively affect content creators’ perceptions of the personas. To address this issue, we have implemented toxicity detection in an algorithmic persona generation system capable of using tens of millions of social media interactions and user comments for persona creation. On the system's user interface, we provide a feature for content creators using the personas to turn on or off toxic quotes, depending on their preferences. To investigate the feasibility of this feature, we conducted a study with 50 professionals in the online publishing domain. The results show varied reactions, including hate-filter critics, hate-filter advocates, and those in between. Although personal preferences play a role, the usefulness of toxicity filtering appears primarily driven by the work task – specifically the type and topic of stories the content creator seeks to create. We identify six use cases where a toxicity filter is beneficial.

We test our hypothesis of detecting toxicity through gameplay with a dataset of almost 1,800 sanctioned players, and comparing these sanctioned players with unsanctioned players. Sanctioned players are defined by their toxic action type (offensive behavior vs. unfair advantage) and degree of severity (warned vs. banned). Our findings, based on supervised learning with random forests, suggest that it is not only possible to behaviorally distinguish sanctioned from unsanctioned players based on selected features of gameplay; it is also possible to predict both the sanction severity (warned vs. banned) and the sanction type (offensive behavior vs. unfair advantage). In particular, all random forest models predict toxicity, its severity, and type, with an accuracy of at least 82%, on average, on unseen players.

 The use of computational tools in the prediction of ADME/Tox properties of compounds is growing rapidly in drug discovery as the benefits they provide in high throughput and early application in drug design are realized. Numerous examples exist of drugs that have had to be withdrawn, because of unacceptable toxicity, in clinical trials and even after reaching the market. In this study phytochemicals from selected spices were used to predict their rodent carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, PPB and BBB. Out of 108 compounds analysed, we found that only five compounds as non-mutagenic and non-carcinogenic and all the remaining were toxic in a pharmacological perspective. The five non-toxic compounds are alpha-zingiberene, delphinidin, laurotetanine, malabaricone-B and malabaricone-C. The PPB values of alpha-zingiberene, delphinidin and laurotetanine are in the <90% range (57.58, 88.41, 52.59, respectively) indicating that the three compounds were weakly bound to plasma proteins and the other two (malabaricone-B and malabaricone-C) strongly binds to plasma protein.

 Drug development is a complex process that requires a rigorous safety assessment. The risk assessment on liver, which plays a central role in drug metabolism in the body, can have a huge impact on drug development. Drug induced liver injury (DILI) has a detrimental impact on human health and remains a leading cause for drug attrition [1]. Toxicogenomics (TGx) has enhanced drug testing and safety prediction, by providing valuable mechanistic insights [2]. Since there are several mechanisms that result in the toxicity endpoint of DILI, the gene expression profiles are diverse, which presents challenges when building TGx signatures for DILI. Thus, compounds with similar characteristics must be used to form a strong expression profile. In this case study, we propose an innovative approach, where each compound's primary and secondary targets and their gene regulatory network (GRN) information is used to inform similar DILI mechanisms. We built a computational pipeline to define each compound's GRN profile and group compounds with similar profiles. This matrix of compounds' GRNs was then transformed using various data transformation and dimension reduction methods. Then, the compounds were clustered into groups based on similarities in their GRN. A DILI predictive machine learning model was built from these groups to identify signature genes and predict DILI from gene expression data. Fitting such models by cluster analysis resulted in a higher accuracy, sensitivity and specificity in compound predictions compared to fitting one model with all compounds.

 With the rise of TikTok’s popularity, there is an opportunity to understand how political communication has been made on this platform based on short videos. In addition to understanding what topics and themes are discussed on TikTok, we also analyzed the polarization and toxic behavior of its users. However, this great opportunity brings a challenge as well. As TikTok is a video platform, the largest content information is in the video itself, so it is necessary to extract this information from video data and features. In this paper, we propose a methodology to extract topics from TikTok video transcriptions in order to identify polarization and toxicity in their contents, by using techniques that range from web crawling to speech recognition algorithms. By providing a robust audio cleaning pipeline, it’s possible to generate a less noisy dataset, by removing silence and music segments. We validate our methodology by practically applying it to create topics in order to identify signs of political polarization and toxicity in 8,329 Brazilian political TikTok videos, collected over the last two years. Our work shows that it is possible to extract coherent and meaningful topics from TikTok videos, even with the challenges spoken texts bring.

 Perspective is a publicly available, machine learning API that can score text for toxicity. It is available for use in online platforms and communities to limit toxicity and promote civil dialogue. In this work, we adopt a human-centered approach to evaluating Perspective by investigating if human ratings of toxicity align with Perspective’s toxicity scores.

We analyzed how participant ratings for these additional attributes vary with respect to Perspective’s toxicity score for comments from each platform. We find that for high toxicity scores, Perspective strongly aligns with participant ratings of toxicity and disrespectfulness across all three platforms, providing weak evidence of its transferability.

6546,"Title:Machine Learning Techniques Predict and Characterize Toxicity between Different Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes

 Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) are a diverse class of engineered nanomaterials known to induce pulmonary toxicity. It is unclear if the mechanisms contributing to the adverse effects are similar or unique when comparing different MWCNT. We hypothesize that machine learning techniques applied to toxicity outcomes will distinguish between convergent and divergent molecular responses. Towards this goal, a panel of proteins measured by multi-plex technology in bronchoalveolar lavage collected 1, 28, and 84 d post-exposure from mice exposed to two different as-produced MWCNT, their polymer coated counterparts, or a well-studied reference material, MWCNT-7, were analyzed using association rule mining (ARM) and support vector machine (SVM) techniques. The main objective was to take advantage of both knowledge represented by class association rules and the power of SVM to identify a small number of highly predictive markers (4 to 7 protein panels out of a total 63 proteins) that can distinguish between exposed and unexposed animals. Using these approaches, we were able to reliably (78% -- 97%) identify a small subset of proteins for each exposure that clearly distinguishes effect of exposure. One mediator in particular, MDC/CCL22, was associated with all exposures. MDC protein levels have been shown to be very sensitive in determining MWCNT exposure and predict declining lung function in humans following particulate exposure. Additional mediators (e.g., VEGF-A, MIP1b) exhibited similarity while others (e.g., LIF, MMP-9, VCAM1, PAI-1) distinguished one exposure from another. In vivo toxicity studies indicate that polymer coating the MWCNT for downstream applications can affect pulmonary toxicity. The machine learning techniques clearly distinguished the polymer coated MWCNT from the as-produced counterpart with up to 96% reliability, depending on particle type and exposure duration. The identified patterns in altered lavage proteins may serve as valuable markers to guide detection of exposure to MWCNT and offer hypothesis for future study design. The approaches presented in this study could enable comparison not only within a class of engineered nanomaterials but between various classes of nanomaterials.","Yanamala N,Bishop LM,Kodali VK,Zeidler-Erdely PC,Erdely AD",,,Machine Learning Techniques Predict and Characterize Toxicity between Different Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes,,,10.1145/2975167.2985664 , Conference Paper,2016,"Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) are a diverse class of engineered nanomaterials known to induce pulmonary toxicity.

In this research, we assess the performance of a freely available model for toxic language detection in online comments called Perspective API, widely adopted by some famous news media sites to identify different toxicity classes in online comments. For that, we obtained comments in Portuguese from two Brazilian news media websites during a politically polarized situation as a use case. Then, this dataset was translated to English and compared to four baseline datasets, two composed of highly toxic comments, one in Portuguese and other in English, and two composed of neutral comments, also one in Portuguese and other in English – all of them in its original language, not translated. Finally, human-annotated comments from the news comments dataset were analyzed to assess the scores provided by the Perspective API for the original and the translated versions.

 Automatic labelling is essential in large corpuses. Engaging in human experts to label can be challenging. Semantic understanding can differ from one labeler to another based on individual's language ability. Platforms such as AmazonTurk are not able to ensure the quality of annotations in every domain. Extensive steps such as qualification and counter checking of labels may be implemented which will increase the cost of data annotation. Thus, the higher quality of labelled data expected, the greater the cost that needs to be expended. This scenario is made worse when the language is of low resource where in this work is the Malay language. Malay is a language used mostly in Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and Brunei. Unlike English which has large resources to tap into the semantics of sentences, making automatic labelling faster to mature, resources in Malay language are still limited. Further compounded is the use of social media data where the text is short, unnormalized and the inherent presence of code switching. The availability of qualified native Malay labelers is also scarce. To overcome this, we devised a method to automatically label a total of 219,444 Malay tweets by using a combination of sentiment, emotion and toxicity polarities.

6554,"Title:“We Found No Violation!”: Twitter's Violent Threats Policy and Toxicity in Online Discourse

 Threat moderation on social media has been subject to much public debate and criticism, especially for its broadly permissive approach. In this paper, we focus on Twitter's Violent Threats policy, highlighting its shortcomings by comparing it to linguistic and legal threat assessment frameworks. Specifically, we foreground the importance of accounting for the lived experiences of harassment—how people perceive and react to a tweet—a measure largely disregarded by Twitter's Violent Threats policy but a core part of linguistic and legal threat assessment frameworks.

 Toxicity is a common problem in online games. Players regularly experience negative, hateful, or inappropriate behavior during gameplay.

To assess the current state of toxicity intervention research, we are conducting a systematic literature review about intervention methods for toxic behaviors in online video games. In this work-in-progress, we report the research protocol for this review and the results from a preliminary analysis. We collected 1176 works from 4 digital libraries and performed abstract and full-text screening, resulting in 30 relevant papers containing 36 intervention systems. By analyzing these intervention systems, we found: 1) Most research proposes novel approaches (n = 28) instead of analyzing existing interventions. 2) Most systems intervene only after toxicity occurs (n = 31) with few interventions that act before toxicity. 3) Only few interventions are evaluated with players and in commercial settings (n = 5), highlighting the potential for more research with higher external validity.

 Chatbots are used in many applications, e.g., automated agents, smart home assistants, interactive characters in online games, etc. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure they do not behave in undesired manners, providing offensive or toxic responses to users. This is not a trivial task as state-of-the-art chatbot models are trained on large, public datasets openly collected from the Internet. This paper presents a first-of-its-kind, large-scale measurement of toxicity in chatbots. We show that publicly available chatbots are prone to providing toxic responses when fed toxic queries. Even more worryingly, some non-toxic queries can trigger toxic responses too. We then set out to design and experiment with an attack, ToxicBuddy, which relies on fine-tuning GPT-2 to generate non-toxic queries that make chatbots respond in a toxic manner. Our extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that our attack is effective against public chatbot models and outperforms manually-crafted malicious queries proposed by previous work. We also evaluate three defense mechanisms against ToxicBuddy, showing that they either reduce the attack performance at the cost of affecting the chatbot's utility or are only effective at mitigating a portion of the attack. This highlights the need for more research from the computer security and online safety communities to ensure that chatbot models do not hurt their users. Overall, we are confident that ToxicBuddy can be used as an auditing tool and that our work will pave the way toward designing more effective defenses for chatbot safety.","Si WM,Backes M,Blackburn J,De Cristofaro E,Stringhini G,Zannettou S,Zhang Y",,,Why So Toxic?

 Toxicity is endemic to online social networks (OSNs) including Twitter. It follows a Pareto-like distribution where most of the toxicity is generated by a very small number of profiles and as such, analyzing and characterizing these “toxic profiles” is critical. Prior research has largely focused on sporadic, event-centric toxic content (i.e., tweets) to characterize toxicity on the platform. Instead, we approach the problem of characterizing toxic content from a profile-centric point of view. We study 143K Twitter profiles and focus on the behavior of the top 1% producers of toxic content on Twitter, based on toxicity scores of their tweets availed by Perspective API. With a total of 293M tweets, spanning 16 years of activity, the longitudinal data allows us to reconstruct the timelines of all profiles involved. We use these timelines to gauge the behavior of the most toxic Twitter profiles compared to the rest of the Twitter population. We study the pattern of tweet posting from highly toxic accounts, based on the frequency and how prolific they are, the nature of hashtags and URLs, profile metadata, and Botometer scores. We find that the highly toxic profiles post coherent and well-articulated content, their tweets keep to a narrow theme with lower diversity in hashtags, URLs, and domains, they are thematically similar to each other, and have a high likelihood of bot-like behavior, likely to have progenitors with intentions to influence, based on high fake followers score.

 Recent advances in natural language processing and machine learning have led to the development of chatbot models, such as ChatGPT, that can engage in conversational dialogue with human users. However, understanding the ability of these models to generate toxic or harmful responses during a non-toxic multi-turn conversation remains an open research problem.

In this paper, we design a new attack, ToxicChat, by fine-tuning a chatbot to engage in conversation with a target open-domain chatbot. The chatbot is fine-tuned with a collection of crafted conversation sequences. Particularly, each conversation begins with a sentence from a crafted prompt sentences dataset. Our extensive evaluation shows that open-domain chatbot models can be triggered to generate toxic responses in a multi-turn conversation. In the best scenario, ToxicChat achieves a 67% toxicity activation rate. The conversation sequences in the fine-tuning stage help trigger the toxicity in a conversation, which allows the attack to bypass two defense methods.

 With the remarkable advances from isolated console games to massively multi-player online role-playing games, the online gaming world provides yet another place where people interact with each other. Online games have attracted attention from researchers, because i) the purpose of actions is relatively clear, and ii) actions are quantifiable. A wide range of predefined actions for supporting social interaction (e.g., friendship, communication, trade, enmity, aggression, and punishment) reflects either positive or negative connotations among game players, and is unobtrusively recorded by the game servers. These rich electronic footprints have become invaluable assets for the research of social dynamics.In particular, exploring negative behavior in online games is a key research direction because it directly influences gaming experience and user satisfaction. Even a few negative players can impact many others because of the design of multi-player games. For this reason these players are called toxic. The definition of toxic play is not cut and dry. Even if someone follows the game rules, he could be considered toxic. For example, killing one player repetitively is often deemed toxic behavior, although it does not break game rules at all. The vagueness of toxicity makes it hard to understand, detect, and prevent it.League of Legends (LoL), created by Riot Games with 70 million users as of 2012, offers a new way to understand toxic behavior. Riot Games develops a crowdsourcing framework, the Tribunal, to judge whether reported toxic behavior should be punished or not. Volunteered players review user reports and vote for either pardon or punishment. As of March 2013, 105 million votes had been collected in North America and Europe.We explore toxic playing and reaction based on large-scale data from the Tribunal[1]. We collect and investigate over 10 million user reports on 1.46 million toxic players and corresponding crowdsourced decisions made in the Tribunal. We crawl data from three different regions, North America, Western Europe, and Korea, to take regional differences of user behavior into account. To obtain the comprehensive view of toxic playing and reaction based on huge data collection, we answer following research questions in a bottom-up approach: how individuals react to toxic players, how teams interact with toxic players, how general toxic or non-toxic players behave across the match, and how crowds make a decision on toxic players. We find large-scale empirical support for some notoriously difficult theories to test in the wild, which are bystander effect, ingroup favoritism, black sheep effect, cohesion-performance relationships, and attribution theory.

 Protecting human and environmental health from the effects of toxic chemicals is an element of sustainability efforts and respecting global biophysical limits. Can this goal be achieved with respect to toxic chemicals used in computing systems? It is likely no surprise that achieving this goal is a wicked problem characterized by multiple disciplinary silos, knowledge gaps, competing priorities and vested interests, problems between organizational boundaries, the need to change human behavior and economic imperatives, and the unintended consequences of solutions.

This resulted in decreasing concentrations in most environments with the important exception of those handling a poorly quantified mass of e-waste in developed and developing countries. Here, e-waste will continue to be a source of exposure to PBDEs for at least the next decade.

 On the world wide web, toxic content detectors are a crucial line of defense against potentially hateful and offensive messages. As such, building highly effective classifiers that enable a safer internet is an important research area. Moreover, the web is a highly multilingual, cross-cultural community that develops its own lingo over time. As such, it is crucial to develop models that are effective across a diverse range of languages, usages, and styles. In this paper, we present the fundamentals behind the next version of the Perspective API from Google Jigsaw. At the heart of the approach is a single multilingual token-free Charformer model that is applicable across a range of languages, domains, and tasks. We demonstrate that by forgoing static vocabularies, we gain flexibility across a variety of settings. We additionally outline the techniques employed to make such a byte-level model efficient and feasible for productionization. Through extensive experiments on multilingual toxic comment classification benchmarks derived from real API traffic and evaluation on an array of code-switching, covert toxicity, emoji-based hate, human-readable obfuscation, distribution shift, and bias evaluation settings, we show that our proposed approach outperforms strong baselines.

 A prominent approach to combating online misinformation is to debunk false content. Here we investigate downstream consequences of social corrections on users’ subsequent sharing of other content. Being corrected might make users more attentive to accuracy, thus improving their subsequent sharing. Alternatively, corrections might not improve subsequent sharing - or even backfire - by making users feel defensive, or by shifting their attention away from accuracy (e.g., towards various social factors). We identified N=2,000 users who shared false political news on Twitter, and replied to their false tweets with links to fact-checking websites. We find causal evidence that being corrected decreases the quality, and increases the partisan slant and language toxicity, of the users’ subsequent retweets (but has no significant effect on primary tweets).

 In this paper, we present the simulation studies to illustrate the benefits of optimal intra-dialytic exercise to improve the toxin removal using the diffusion-adjusted regional blood flow (DA-RBF) model developed by Schneditz et al. To optimize the exercise effect, two exercise-related parameters, i.e. the inter-compartmental mass transfer coefficient (KC), cardiac output (QC), and time of implementation for 3 bouts of exercise (t1, t2, and t3) were considered as decision variables. A control vector parameterization method was used to optimize a realistic intra-dialytic exercise profile. During exercise, QC and KC were allowed to vary between their nominal values and 100% and 400% increase, respectively. Initial simulation suggested that during exercise, QC and KC reaches their maximum permissible values, thus only timings of exercise implementation were considered as decision variables in optimization. Results from the simulation study reveal that during the 3 bouts of optimal intermittent exercise, remotely sequestered solutes can be removed from the low flow region. As such, more toxins are removed in the dialyzer which consistently results in a decrease in percentage rebound (indicator of increased toxin removal) during the post-dialysis period for both urea and creatinine.","Ahmad Y,Maheshwari V,Rangaiah GP,Leong TL,Samavedham L",,,Optimal Intra-Dialytic Exercise Protocol for Improving the Toxin Removal in Hemodialysis Patients,,, , Conference Paper,2012,"In this paper, we present the simulation studies to illustrate the benefits of optimal intra-dialytic exercise to improve the toxin removal using the diffusion-adjusted regional blood flow (DA-RBF) model developed by Schneditz et al.

These results demonstrate the potential utility — and risks — of LLMs for augmenting cross-domain analogical creativity.",,,,,Association for Computing Machinery ,Proceedings of the 15th Conference on Creativity and Cognition  ,"Large Language Models, Analogy, Creativity Support Tools",out_of_scope,

 One problem facing players of competitive games is negative, or toxic, behavior.

The Tribunal is a two stage system requiring reports from those players that directly observe toxic behavior, and human experts that review aggregated reports.

 This paper identifies two kinds of redundancy in the current VideoQA paradigm. Specifically, the current video encoders tend to holistically embed all video clues at different granularities in a hierarchical manner, which inevitably introducesneighboring-frame redundancy that can overwhelm detailed visual clues at the object level. Subsequently, prevailing vision-language fusion designs introduce thecross-modal redundancy by exhaustively fusing all visual elements with question tokens without explicitly differentiating their pairwise vision-language interactions, thus making a pernicious impact on the answering. To this end, we propose a novel transformer-based architecture, that aims to model VideoQA in a redundancy-aware manner. To address the neighboring-frame redundancy, we introduce a video encoder structure that emphasizes the object-level change in neighboring frames, while adopting an out-of-neighboring message-passing scheme that imposes attention only on distant frames.

 The potentially detrimental effects of cyberbullying have led to the development of numerous automated, data–driven approaches, with emphasis on classification accuracy. Cyberbullying, as a form of abusive online behavior, although not well–defined, is a repetitive process, i.e., a sequence of aggressive messages sent from a bully to a victim over a period of time with the intent to harm the victim.Existing work has focused on harassment (i.e., using profanity to classify toxic comments independently) as an indicator of cyberbullying, disregarding the repetitive nature of this harassing process. However, raising a cyberbullying alert immediately after an aggressive comment is detected can lead to a high number of false positives. At the same time, two key practical challenges remain unaddressed: (i) timeliness: the state–of–the–art relies on a fixed set of features learned during training for offline detection (i.e., after all correspondence has become available), hindering the ability to respond in a timely manner (i.e., as soon as possible) to cyberbullying events. (ii) scalabilty: the scalability of existing methods to the staggering rates at which content is generated (e.g., 95 million photos and videos are shared on Instagram per day1) has largely remained unaddressed.In my lightning talk, I will introduce CONcISE, a novel approach for timely and accurate Cyberbullying detectiON on Instagram media SEssions, that has been accepted for presentation at the main conference [1]. Specifically, I will present a novel two–stage online approach (illustrated in Figure 1) designed to reduce the time to raise a cyberbullying alert by (i) sequentially examining comments as they become available over time, and (ii) minimizing the number of feature evaluations necessary for a decision to be made for each comment. By formalizing the problem as a sequential hypothesis testing problem, a novel algorithm has been developed that satisfies four key properties: accuracy, repetitiveness, timeliness, and efficiency.Extensive experiments on a real–world Instagram dataset with ∼ 4M users and ∼ 10M comments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach with respect to accuracy, timeliness, efficiency, and robustness, and show that it consistently outperforms the stat–of–the–art, often by a considerable margin.","Yao M,Chelmis C,Zois DS",,,Lightning Talk–Towards Robust Detection of Cyberbullying in Social Media,,,10.1145/3308560.3316474 , Conference Paper,2019,"The potentially detrimental effects of cyberbullying have led to the development of numerous automated, data–driven approaches, with emphasis on classification accuracy.

 In this work, we address the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 13: Climate Action by focusing on identifying public attitudes toward climate change on social media platforms such as Twitter. Climate change is threatening the health of the planet and humanity. Public engagement is critical to address climate change. However, climate change conversations on Twitter tend to polarize beliefs, leading to misinformation and fake news that influence public attitudes, often dividing them into climate change believers and deniers. Our paper proposes an approach to classify the attitude of climate change tweets (believe/deny/ambiguous) to identify denier statements on Twitter. Most existing approaches for detecting stances and classifying climate change tweets either overlook deniers’ tweets or do not have a suitable architecture. The relevant literature suggests that emotions and higher levels of toxicity are prevalent in climate change Twitter conversations, leading to a delay in appropriate climate action. Therefore, our work focuses on learning stance detection (main task) while exploiting the auxiliary tasks of recognizing emotions and offensive utterances. We propose a multimodal multitasking framework MEMOCLiC that captures the input data using different embedding techniques and attention frameworks, and then incorporates the learned emotional and offensive expressions to obtain an overall representation of the features relevant to the stance of the input tweet.

In scenarios like disaster management and homeland security, in case some of the sensors dispersed in a larger geographic area report a value higher than a certain threshold, one may want to ensure a quality of the readings for the affected region. This, in turn, implies that one may want to ensure that there are enough sensors there and, consequently, guide a subset of the rest of the sensors towards the affected region.

Quorum sensing is used by bacteria in the formation of biofilms, secretion of digestive enzymes and, in the case of pathogenic bacteria, release of toxins or other virulence factors. Indeed, methods to disrupt quorum sensing are currently being investigated as possible treatments for numerous diseases, including cystic fibrosis, epidemic cholera, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. In this paper we demonstrate the evolution of a quorum sensing behavior in populations of digital organisms. Specifically, we show that digital organisms are capable of evolving a strategy to collectively suppress self-replication, when the population density reaches a specific, evolved threshold.

 The prevalence and perniciousness of fake news has been a critical issue on the Internet, which stimulates the development of automatic fake news detection in turn. In this paper, we focus on the evidence-based fake news detection, where several evidences are utilized to probe the veracity of news (i.e., a claim). Most previous methods first employ sequential models to embed the semantic information and then capture the claim-evidence interaction based on different attention mechanisms. Despite their effectiveness, they still suffer from two main weaknesses. Firstly, due to the inherent drawbacks of sequential models, they fail to integrate the relevant information that is scattered far apart in evidences for veracity checking. Secondly, they neglect much redundant information contained in evidences that may be useless or even harmful. To solve these problems, we propose a unified Graph-based sEmantic sTructure mining framework, namely GET in short. Specifically, different from the existing work that treats claims and evidences as sequences, we model them as graph-structured data and capture the long-distance semantic dependency among dispersed relevant snippets via neighborhood propagation. After obtaining contextual semantic information, our model reduces information redundancy by performing graph structure learning. Finally, the fine-grained semantic representations are fed into the downstream claim-evidence interaction module for predictions. Comprehensive experiments have demonstrated the superiority of GET over the state-of-the-arts.","Xu W,Wu J,Liu Q,Wu S,Wang L",,,Evidence-Aware Fake News Detection with Graph Neural Networks,,,10.1145/3485447.3512122 , Conference Paper,2022,"The prevalence and perniciousness of fake news has been a critical issue on the Internet, which stimulates the development of automatic fake news detection in turn.

To solve these problems, we propose a unified Graph-based sEmantic sTructure mining framework, namely GET in short. Specifically, different from the existing work that treats claims and evidences as sequences, we model them as graph-structured data and capture the long-distance semantic dependency among dispersed relevant snippets via neighborhood propagation. After obtaining contextual semantic information, our model reduces information redundancy by performing graph structure learning. Finally, the fine-grained semantic representations are fed into the downstream claim-evidence interaction module for predictions. Comprehensive experiments have demonstrated the superiority of GET over the state-of-the-arts.",,,9781450390965,,Association for Computing Machinery ,Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2022  ,"evidence-based fake news detection, graph neural networks",out_of_scope,

 Compared to scintillator based PET detectors, semiconductor detectors tend to provide excellent energy and spatial resolution. However, due to the relatively slow charge carrier collection time limited by the carrier drift velocity, semiconductor based detectors have poor time resolution in the range of several nanoseconds or greater. Possibilities exist to collect prompt photons emitted from certain semiconductor materials in order to greatly improve the timing capability. In this work, we studied the prompt photon emission property and fast timing capability of two new perovskite semiconductor materials, CsPbCl3 and CsPbBr3, and compared them with TlBr, which has been previously studied for its Cerenkov emission property. The coincidence time resolution (CTR) acquired between a 3 × 3 × 3 mm3 semiconductor sample crystal and a 3 × 3 × 3 mm3 reference LYSO crystal are 238 ± 16 ps, 468 ± 55 ps and 384 ± 31 ps for CsPbCl3, CsPbBr3, and TlBr respectively, when the LYSO crystal was only triggered on photoelectric events. When we lowered the trigger level and allowed the LYSO crystal to be triggered on all events including Compton scattering, we acquired CTR of 281 ± 17ps, 499 ± 77ps and 422 ± 46ps for CsPbCt3, CsPbBr3, and TlBr respectively.

6633,"Title:Study of Annihilation Photon Pair Coincidence Time Resolution Using Prompt Photon Emissions in New Perovskite Bulk Crystals

 Semiconductor-based radiation detectors can typically achieve better energy and spatial resolution when compared to scintillator-based detectors. However, if used for positron emission tomography (PET), semiconductor-based detectors normally cannot achieve excellent coincidence time resolution (CTR), due to the relatively slow charge carrier collection time limited by the carrier drift velocity. If we can collect prompt photons emitted from certain semiconductor materials, there are possibilities that the CTR can be greatly improved, and time-of-flight (ToF) capability can be achieved. In this article, we studied the prompt photon emission (mainly, the Cherenkov luminescence) property and fast timing capability of cesium lead chloride (CsPbCl3) and cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr3), which are two new perovskite semiconductor materials. We also compared their performance with thallium bromide (TlBr), another semiconductor material that has already been studied for timing using its Cherenkov emissions. We performed coincidence measurements using silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs), and the full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) CTR acquired between a semiconductor sample crystal and a reference lutetium-yttrium oxyorthosilicate (LYSO) crystal (both with dimensions of $3\times 3\times 3\,\mathrm {mm^{3}}$ ) is ${\mathbf {248\pm 8~ps}}$ for CsPbCl3, ${\mathbf {440\pm 31~ps}}$ for CsPbBr3, and ${\mathbf {343\pm 16~ps}}$ for TlBr. Deconvolving the contribution to CTR from the reference LYSO crystal (around 100 ps) and then multiplying by the square root of 2, the estimated CTR between two of the same semiconductor crystals was calculated as ${\mathbf {324\pm 10~ps}}$ for CsPbCl3, ${\mathbf {606\pm 43~ps}}$ for CsPbBr3, and ${\mathbf {464\pm 22~ps}}$ for TlBr.

 FLASH radiation therapy (RT) has been recently proposed as a novel modality that features reduced toxicity to healthy tissue while maintaining the same antitumor efficacy as conventional radiotherapy. FLASH-RT is characterized by the delivery of ultra-high dose rates (> 40 Gy/s) in sub-second treatment times. Real-time beam monitoring and dosimetry for FLASH are challenging and new approaches have been proposed to address this issue. Along this line, novel detectors based on fiber-coupled scintillators are under development at the University of Bern. This work reports on the characterization of a detector prototype made of a sample of Cerium-doped Gadolinium Aluminum Gallium Garnet (Ce:GAGG) of size (0.5×0.5×2) mm3 coupled to an optical fiber. The scintillation light pulses are driven to a single photon detector and to a multi-channel scaler operated at 10 kHz sampling rate. Functional tests have been performed at the Francis H. Burr Proton Therapy Center at the Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, MA) with 227.5 MeV proton beams. The detector response was found to be linear in the range 4-120 Gy/s (maximum dose rate available). We compared the GAGG depth dose curve with that of a reference ion chamber and of a rectifier diode. We observed a reduction of the GAGG signal which is likely due to quenching effects and loss of in-scattering contribution in the sub-millimeter volume of the scintillator, and is currently under investigation.

 In Particle Therapy, cancer treatments are performed using accelerated charged particles whose high irradiation precision and conformity permit to destroy the tumour while sparing the surrounding healthy tissues. Several secondary particles are produced during the treatments mainly photons, protons and neutrons. The reduced attenuation length of neutrons yields a secondary particle sample that is larger in number when compared to photons and charged particles. Since neutrons can release a significant dose far away from the tumour region, a precise measurement of their flux, production energy and angle distributions is eagerly needed in order to improve the Treatment Planning Systems (TPS) software, so to properly take into account not only the normal tissue toxicity in the target region, but also the risk of late complications in the whole body. The MONDO (MOnitor for Neutron Dose in hadrOntherapy) project addresses the technical challenges posed by a neutron detector aiming for high detection efficiency and good backtracking precision. The main goal of the project is to develop a tracking detector targeting fast and ultra-fast secondary neutrons based on the reconstruction of two consequent elastic scattering interactions of a neutron with a target material. By reconstructing the recoiling protons, it is hence possible to measure the energy and incoming direction of the neutron using different therapeutic beams (protons, 12C ions and possibly 4He and 16O ions).

The main goal of the project is to develop a tracking detector targeting fast and ultra-fast secondary neutrons based on the reconstruction of two consequent elastic scattering interactions of a neutron with a target material. By reconstructing the recoiling protons, it is hence possible to measure the energy and incoming direction of the neutron using different therapeutic beams (protons, 12C ions and possibly 4He and 16O ions). The detector will be composed by a tracker realized with squared scintillating fibres and read out by a dedicated CMOS-based digital SPAD array detector. The first experimental results of a tracker demonstrator are here presented.",,,,, ,"  2016 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium, Medical Imaging Conference and Room-Temperature Semiconductor Detector Workshop (NSS/MIC/RTSD)",,out_of_scope,

 In this paper, we further explore the optical property modulation-based method for ionizing radiation photon detection in PET as a potential new direction to dramatically improve the coincidence time resolution. We compare the performance of three detector crystals for this method including two types of cadmium telluride (CdTe) crystals and one bismuth silicon oxide (BSO) crystal under high bias voltages up to 3500V. We first show that the induced current flow in the detector crystal determines the strength of the optical property modulation signal due to ionization. A larger resistivity is favorable for reducing the dark current (noise) in the crystal and facilitates the detection of weak optical property modulation signals. In addition, we show that BSO is a potential candidate detector material. When biased at 3500 V, it has comparable modulation signal sensitivity as CdTe biased at 1000V, but with higher resistivity (lower noise), larger 511 keV photon attenuation coefficient, lower price, better crystal surface finish quality, and less toxicity. By studying the dependence of modulation signal amplitude on crystal bias voltage, we show that the modulation signal amplitude (induced by both UV laser diode and Ge-68 source) is linearly proportional to crystal bias voltage with a linear fit R factor of around 0.95. The modulation signal amplitude induced by UV laser diode irradiation increases from 0% to 2% (normalized to the average signal level) for both CdTe and BSO under crystal bias voltage from 0V to 3500V. The modulation signal amplitude induced by Ge-68 irradiation increases from 0% to 12% for CdTe under crystal bias voltage from 0V to 1500 V, and increases from 0% to 10% for BSO under crystal bias voltage from 0V to 3500 V.

 Radiopharmaceutical therapy with alpha particle emitters (αRPT) offers an advantage in the treatment of refractory or metastatic cancers, such as metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), by using a precise targeting strategy to exploit the high therapeutic specificity of short-range (40-80 μm) cytotoxic alpha particles. 225Ac-based radiopharmaceuticals have shown high efficacy in several clinical trials, but off-target toxicity suggests that improvements are needed in radiochemistry and progeny radionuclide management. However, the limited availability of data and technologies that quantify dose distribution on spatial scales relevant to the alpha particle range impairs accurate characterization of novel αRPT agents. Here, we demonstrate that 2D digital autoradiography with an ionizing-radiation quantum imaging detector (iQID) can facilitate 3D volumetric dosimetry of targeted and non-targeted tissues. A series of 10-μm cryosections extracted every 200 μm spanning the organ or tumor is measured with the device. These activity maps are used in a previously developed Monte Carlo dose kernel convolution procedure to obtain dose-rate images, which we digitally register into a 3D volume via intensity-maximization rigid-body transformations. The resulting dose-rate organ or tumor volume has an effective voxel size of 39 x 39 x 210 μm. To permit the measurement of only one slice at each position, we validate a digital duplication approximation with a secondary experiment measuring 10 consecutive 10-μmslices in each tissue.

 Alpha-emitter radiopharmaceutical therapy (αRPT) becomes a promising cancer treatment, which harnesses the high linear energy transfer (LET) and short range of α-particles to deliver targeted destruction of cancer cells.

 The dosimeters for radiotherapy must comply to strict requirements in terms of sensitivity, toxicity, tissue equivalence and radiation hardness. At present time both silicon and diamond dosimeters are used as solid state devices and in recent years, monocrystalline diamond sensors have been grown with CVD techniques. Due to the low current signals, the sensor readout is made by electrometers connected to the device with multi wire shielded cables. This measurement setup may be a serious limitation for practical application of these sensors, and makes impossible the use of matrix sensors.

 Because of toxic gases and fast propagation speed, smoke causes the major injuries and deaths than burns in the fire. Deploying IoT enabled smoke sensors not only help to sense, collect, and transmit the smoke data to the control station, but also enable a dynamic and real-time evacuation approach to increase the evacuation success probability. In this paper, two smoke-aware evacuation approaches are proposed. The individual evacuation mathematical model and the associated SIEP algorithm are first devised to identify a fastest smoke toxic safe evacuation path for an evacuee. Next, the group evacuation mathematical model and the associated SGEP algorithm are devised to evacuate as many evacuees as possible in considering the smoke toxicity and flow congestion along the evacuation routes. SGEP circumvents the congestion problem by scheduling the evacuation sequence according to evacuee’s accumulated smoke toxicity value, where higher accumulated smoke toxicity value has higher evacuation priority to prevent incapacitation at evacuation. The FDS simulations based on the real layout of Taipei 101 mall are performed to compare the evacuation success probability between SIEP and SGEP at methane fire and PVC fire. The simulation results show that smoke from PVC fire is more toxic than that of methane fire. In addition, enabling sprinklers can reduce the percentage of toxic nodes up to 41% at methane fire and up to 10% at PCV fire, as compared to not enabling them. These results indicate that it is more challenging to evacuate at PVC fire than at methane fire. The simulation results in SGEP and SIEP justify the above conclusions where the success evacuation probability differences between methane fire and PVC fire are up to 39% (i.e., 100% and 61%) and 52.5% (i.e., 82.5% and 30%) for SGEP and SIEP, respectively. The simulation results also show that SGEP outperforms SIEP in terms of evacuation success probability at all simulation settings, especially when large number of evacuees are to be evacuated. At methane fire, the largest evacuation success probability difference between SGEP and SIEP is 68.1% at 1000 evacuees, 0.3 FED threshold and without sprinklers. At PVC fire, the largest difference is 50% at 1000 evacuees, 0.5 FED threshold and with sprinklers. These significant differences in evacuation success probability come from the evacuation congestion in SIEP. The evacuation scheduling approach based on accumulated smoke toxicity policy enables SGEP to circumvent the evacuation congestion, and to get better evacuation success probability. Besides identifying safe evacuation route and evacuation scheduling policy during congestion to evacuate more evacuees, another contribution of this paper is to identify the critical percentage of toxic nodes for safe fire evacuation and rescue operations.","Yen, Hong-Hsu, Lin, Cheng-Han, Tsao, Hung-Wei",,,Novel Smoke-Aware Individual Evacuation and Congestion-Aware Group Evacuation Algorithms in IoT-Enabled Multi-Story Multi-Exit Buildings,,,10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3221757 , ,2022,"Because of toxic gases and fast propagation speed, smoke causes the major injuries and deaths than burns in the fire.

 Marine sediments often serve as important sinks for anthropogenic contaminants from the overlying water column. In certain cases the sediments may also serve as contaminant sources, releasing contaminants later when water column and/or pore water conditions change. Variations in sediment chemical and physical properties make it impossible to rely on bulk sediment contaminant concentrations alone to predict contaminant flux, bioavailability, and therefore toxicity. In situ measurements of contaminant fluxes across the sediment-water interface provide important information for addressing these concerns. The Navy has recently developed the Benthic Flux Sampling Device (BFSD) to assess contaminant fluxes across the sediment-water interface. The BFSD has recently undergone several modifications to allow improved operation. The oxygen regulation system has been modified to allow better control of chamber oxygen levels. Some deployments have utilized real-time sensors that allow monitoring of BFSD operations and offer the potential to serve as field-screening tools to evaluate contaminant mobility. These real-time sensor techniques include potentiometric stripping analysis (PSA) for metals and laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) for hydrocarbon contaminants. As part of the Navy's ongoing program to monitor environmental conditions in San Diego Bay, this study used multiple deployments of the BFSD to assess contaminant fluxes across the sediment-water interface. In coastal areas, directly measured BFSD fluxes are often preferable to model-dependent fluxes obtained from pore water profiles. Target contaminants in this study included the trace metals Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn. Initial results indicate fluxes occur both into and out of the sediments depending on contaminant type and site location. The metals that showed the most consistent flux out of the sediments included Zn and Mn.","Leather, J.M., Chadwick, D.B., Koon, G.H.",,,Contaminant flux measurements across the sediment-water interface in San Diego Bay,,,10.1109/OCEANS.1995.528740 , ,1995,"Marine sediments often serve as important sinks for anthropogenic contaminants from the overlying water column.

Some deployments have utilized real-time sensors that allow monitoring of BFSD operations and offer the potential to serve as field-screening tools to evaluate contaminant mobility. These real-time sensor techniques include potentiometric stripping analysis (PSA) for metals and laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) for hydrocarbon contaminants. As part of the Navy's ongoing program to monitor environmental conditions in San Diego Bay, this study used multiple deployments of the BFSD to assess contaminant fluxes across the sediment-water interface. In coastal areas, directly measured BFSD fluxes are often preferable to model-dependent fluxes obtained from pore water profiles. Target contaminants in this study included the trace metals Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn. Initial results indicate fluxes occur both into and out of the sediments depending on contaminant type and site location. The metals that showed the most consistent flux out of the sediments included Zn and Mn.",,,,, ,  'Challenges of Our Changing Global Environment'. Conference Proceedings.

 This paper presents the development of air quality monitoring system based on internet of things, IOT application to control the concentration of carbon dioxide gas and carbon monoxide gas in car cabin. Carbon monoxide is one most dangerous gas and nowadays there were many fatal cases happen caused by the gas leakage, while increasing of the concentration carbon dioxide will reduce oxygen level in the air, thus can cause the driver to be fatigue, and sleepiness. Moreover, gas detector usually not installed in nowadays car. To develop smart air quality monitoring system, Arduino MKR 1010, CJMCU 811(carbon dioxide sensor), MQ-7(carbon monoxide sensor), Adafruit io application, IFTTT, Webhooks, Telegram, and MATLAB fuzzy logic toolbox were used. Furthermore, Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) was used to analyze the input and produce the system's output decisions on the level of gas toxicities. The five levels of gas toxicities are very safe, safe, warning, high, and very high.

 Brominated flame retardants (BFRs) are ubiquitous industrial chemicals likely to persistently exist in the environment, bioaccumulate in food chains, and even may cause adverse health effects in human. Borgundfjorden fjord system, an important spawning ground for the Norwegian coastal cod (Gadus morhua) stock, was contaminated by significant levels of pollutants such as BFRs, due to the local previous industrial activities. In this study, we demonstrated high level of the BFRs polybrominated biphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in cod liver and gonad samples from Borgundfjorden using mass spectroscopy (MS) detectors by Norwegian National Institute of Nutrition and Seafood Research (NIFES). Acute embryo toxicity test was further conducted using fertilized cod eggs. The eggs were short-term exposed to serial dilutions of five BFRs mixtures, BDE-47, or PCB mixture Aroclor 1254. At a concentration 10 times that detected in cod liver, the mixture of the five BFRs significantly reduced the embryo survival rate (p <; 0.01). Correspondingly, at 224 μg/L, which was around 10 times of that detected in cod liver, BDE-47 exhibited obvious cod embryo toxicity (p <; 0.01). As a positive control, Aroclor 1254 significantly reduced the embryo survival rate at 400 and 1600 μg/L (p <;0.001).

6671,"Title:Chemical Agent Detection Using GC-IMS: A Comparative Study

 Low-cost and portable gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry (GC-IMS) has been used to identify chemicals. To accomplish this, two parameters are used. The first parameter relates to the GC retention time (RT), which is the residence time of an analyte as it passes through the column. Different chemicals have different RTs. The second parameter is the drift time of ionized species derived for a specific chemical in the IMS. Due to molecular cross section, mass, and chemical properties, different chemicals produce ionized species with different drift times. Combining these two parameters, GC-IMS has been shown to distinguish between different chemicals. Chemical detection and identification are not that easy in practice. First, the concentration of chemicals may be very low, and it may be difficult to determine the chromatographic RT and IMS drift time for chemicals under these conditions. Second, the specific ionized species produced in the IMS are concentration dependent and the IMS spectra obtained at different analyte concentrations are not easily predictable. For example, at low concentrations, chemicals seldom form dimers following atmospheric pressure ionization. The possible presence of either monomers or dimers in the IMS drift tube may confuse the chemical classification process. Third, it is important to estimate the concentration of chemicals, as this information will provide toxicity, and the linear dynamic range of typical IMS systems is relatively low In this study, an image processing approach to enhancing the GC-IMS signal quality is introduced. The key idea in this approach is to treat GC-IMS data as an image and then apply an anomaly detector to detect and enhance abnormal regions in the image. The results of a study that compares a conventional approach to chemical detection and the introduced image enhancement approach are presented.

Specifically, this research study aims to improve the model’s ability to detect and classify subtle forms of toxic language by incorporating additional contextual information and leveraging techniques such as adversarial training and data augmentation to increase the diversity of training data. This study also plans to evaluate the model’s performance on a range of real-world datasets to ensure its effectiveness in practical settings.",,,,, ,  2023 International Conference on Sustainable Computing and Smart Systems (ICSCSS),,detection#evaluation#methodology,

 Online users nowadays leave a lot of comments on various social networks, news websites, and forums. Certain comments are harmful or abusive. Since it is impractical to manually monitor so many comments, the majority of systems employ some form of a machine learning model to automatically identify harmful content. Much of the work has been done for the English language. However, only a few approaches have been taken to classify toxic comments in the Bangla language. A multi-label classification technique for Bangla comments is offered in the study that follows to classify the numerous toxic comments into six categories: toxic, severe toxic, obscene, threat, insult, and identity hate, and also measure the severity of these comments. For the experiment, we compiled a dataset of 12634 comments from TikTok and other sources. By incorporating knowledge from earlier proposed studies, the proposed classification model was developed utilizing deep learning techniques, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Long Short-Term Memory-Convolutional Neural Networks (LSTM-CNNs), as well as word embeddings and obtained a maximum accuracy of 83.66% and 1.61 MSE loss for the severity measure.11https://github.com/imbodrulalam/Toxic-Comment-Detection-BN","Haque, Naimul, Alam, Md.

Along with providing a way for enhanced communication, these platforms also allow internet users to voice their opinions which get circulated among the masses within seconds. Moreover, given the different backgrounds, believes, ethnicity and cultures that the users on these platforms come from, many of them tend to use mean, aggressive and hateful content during their discussions with people not hailing from a background similar to theirs.

 Social media is an effective tool for connecting with people and distributing information. However, many people often use social media to spread hate speech and abusive languages. In contrast to hate speech, abusive languages are frequently used as jokes with no purpose of offending individuals or groups, even though they may contain profanities. As a result, the distinction between hate speech and abusive language is often blurred. In many cases, individuals who spread hate speech may be prosecuted as it has legal implications. Previous research has focused on binary classification of hate speech and normal tweets. This study aims to classify hate speech, abusive language, and normal messages on Indonesian Twitter. Several machine learning models, such as logistic regression and BERT models, are utilized to accomplish text classification tasks. The model's performance is assessed using the F1-Score evaluation metric. The results show that BERT models outperform other models in terms of F1-Score, with the BERT-indobenchmark model, which was pretrained on social media text data, achieving the highest F1-Score of 85.59.

Present solutions are largely based on censorship and removal of such content and can be the cause of mental disturbance to the concerned auditor. Biases of manual moderation can thwart the efforts taken to prevent the presence of hate speech on online platforms. However, posts that convey important meanings also fall prey to such systems, which should be avoided. Such systems fail to educate their authors what should have been done differently. Additionally, a system that combines detection and substitution algorithms is largely absent. A euphemistic substitution approach could prove to be more effective.

 Speaking hatefully is an antisocial conduct. Hate can be expressed on the basis of gender, race, or religion, ethnic, etc. The definition of “hate speech” is ambiguous. The Hate speech is defined by the Council of the European Union as “any types of expression which disseminate, provoke, or defend intolerance as a reason for racial hatred, xenophobia, antisemitism, or other types of hatred, including violent nationalism and ethnocentrism, as well as prejudice and hatred toward migrants, minorities, and those with immigrant backgrounds. The most pressing issue in recent times in social media and online groups is toxicity identification sites for networking. Therefore, it is necessary to create an automatic hazardous identification system to keep people out of and restrict their access to these online settings.

Furthermore, high-precision hydrogen sulfide detection sensors are generally expensive. This finding has important implications for developing robust gas sensors.

 Various forms of social interactions are often char-acterized by toxic or offensive words that can be collectively referred to as offensive languages, which has become a unique linguistic phenomenon in social media platforms. How to detect and identify these offensive languages in social media platforms has become one of the important research in the field of natural language processing. Existing methods utilize machine learning algorithms or text representation models based on deep learning to learn the features of offensive languages and identify them, which have achieved good performances. However, traditional machine learning-based methods mainly rely on keyword identi-fication and blocking, deep learning-based methods do not ade-quately explore the fused deep semantic features of the content by combining word-level embeddings and sentence-level deep semantic feature representations of sentences, which cannot ef-fectively identify offensive languages that do not contain common offensive words but indicate offensive meanings. In this research, we propose a novel offensive language identification model based on deep semantic feature fusion, which uses the pre-trained model Bert to obtain word-level embedding representations of offensive languages, and then integrates the RCNN that combines with the attention mechanism to extract the fused deep semantic feature representations of offensive languages, and label encoder and offensive predictor to improve the identification accuracy and generalization ability of the model so that the performances of the model do not rely on the offensive language lexicon entirely and can identify offensive languages that do not contain common offensive words but indicate offensive meanings.

However, traditional machine learning-based methods mainly rely on keyword identi-fication and blocking, deep learning-based methods do not ade-quately explore the fused deep semantic features of the content by combining word-level embeddings and sentence-level deep semantic feature representations of sentences, which cannot ef-fectively identify offensive languages that do not contain common offensive words but indicate offensive meanings. In this research, we propose a novel offensive language identification model based on deep semantic feature fusion, which uses the pre-trained model Bert to obtain word-level embedding representations of offensive languages, and then integrates the RCNN that combines with the attention mechanism to extract the fused deep semantic feature representations of offensive languages, and label encoder and offensive predictor to improve the identification accuracy and generalization ability of the model so that the performances of the model do not rely on the offensive language lexicon entirely and can identify offensive languages that do not contain common offensive words but indicate offensive meanings. Experimental results on Wikipedia and Twitter comment datasets show that our proposed model can better understand the context and discover potential offensive meanings, and outperforms existing methods.",,,,, ,  2022 IEEE 8th International Conference on Computer and Communications (ICCC),,detection,

The L298N board, HC-05, Arduino Uno microcontroller, ultrasonic sensor, battery, and jumping wires are included in this system. The robot movement and control system is used by the speaker to allow the robot to react to any speaker command that gives any verbal instruction that produces sound frequencies of the human voice. Through the software application, the user of a robotic car will choose the route or path to control the movement of the car. The user can monitor the robot's movements on his own smart device and allow the car to drive in his own way. In this method, a microcontroller with android devices is linked through a bluetooth module to receive desired voice commands. The robot then escapes obstacles and detects distant objects. The android application that is used to convert a voice to a text command and then transmit data to a microcontroller moves the robot via a voice application according to the user's command. After receiving the command, the robot moves in left, right, forward, and backward directions.

 Haze is defined as a poor condition described by an iridescent atmospheric appearance that reduces clarity and visibility. The main reason for this is lot of toxic elements like dust particles, smoke in the atmosphere scattering and absorbing sun light. This poor intelligibility causes various computer vision applications to fail, including intelligent transportation, video surveillance, element recognition, and in a method to perform operations on image to get better image. There is a problem in domain of image processing wherein image recovery by various degradations is a challenge. Pictures and videos taken in outdoor environments usually suffer from reduced contrast, faded colors and with reduced visibility due to airborne particles, which directly affect image quality. This can lead to problems recognizing objects captured in blurry or still images.

 Transformers play critical roles in delivering power to distribution equipment for homes, commercial establishments and industrial facilities. Sudden failure of a transformer can have many serious repercussions leading to loss of power for a few minutes to hours. There are instances an outage could last for weeks because of system configuration, such as a simple radial system or the transformer was the single point failure. In industrial complexes an outage lasting a few minutes could lead to loss opportunities as well as millions of dollars in lost production and start up costs. Many older transformers have been in operation for more than 80 years without failure or major problems. Although there have been recent failures of units producing fires and explosions resulting in the release of toxic and combustible gases as well as smoke into the atmosphere; also OSHA has levied fines because of the type of incident. Many transformers in the petrochemical industry now fall under OSHA 1910.119, Mechanical Integrity regulations due to probability of catastrophic failure during power loss, resulting in release of highly hazardous chemicals. Transformers tanks containing more than 10,000 pounds of aggregates in some cases fall underneath the 1910.119 as well as 1910.269 regulations. Mineral oil in transformers is used as a media for cooling and insulating parts within close proximity. Mineral oil has a NFPA flammability rating of 1, indicating it is slightly flammable with a health rating of 1 as well, indicating a slight health hazard. However, during fault conditions mineral oil can be hazardous to your health and the environment. The purpose of this paper is to provide information and insight related to repair or outright replacement of aging transformers containing mineral oil under fault conditions such as the production of combustible gases. This paper will explain how oil sampling, gas analyses, internal inspection and testing were used to determine which required replacing or simple repairs. It will explain the use of standards such as IEEE C57 guidelines, to determine loading, hours of operation, degradation and other tests used to evaluate conditions and suitability for future operation of transformers. It will discuss the use of insulation power factor, Furan and other tests to help predict remaining life in transformers.

 The transformers have been widely used in traditional power system, the primary functions of which are voltage-transformation, isolation and energy-transfer. Now with the development of Smart-Grid, power system requires an increasing penetration of the renewable energy resources and other distributed generations around loads, and an active role for DSOs in controlling the network stability, optimizing central and security. Owing to the bulky iron cores, heavy copper windings and simple functions, the traditional transformer can't satisfy the requirements of SG. Power Electronic Transformer which has been developed for years, can adjust to the development of SG, and improve the performance of distribution system. This paper presents a new topology of PET based on three-level converter, which is used in active medium-voltage distribution network, and supplies a possible solution for bi-directional energy flow of generated loads, and the stability of PS. With the high-performance control strategies-SVM, PET not only realized the all functions of old transformers, but also permitted the distributed power to inject into network. Additionally, the proposed PET performs typical functions and has advantages such as power factor correction, voltage regulation, voltage sag and swell elimination, voltage flicker reduction and protection capability in fault situations. In addition, it has other benefits such as light weight, low volume and no toxic dielectric coolants. First the paper introduced the fundamentals of PET, and studied on the mathematical model of the new topology. In order to verify the validity of this device, we used MATLAB/PST software to simulate the PET model. As a result of divided DC bus with H-bridge converter and connecting of DGs, the neural point's voltage of DC-Bus is unbalanced, the paper proposed an arithmetic to overcome this problem and suppress the effect of ripple voltage on common DC-bus.

 It has been more than a hundred year since mineral oil was used as liquid insulation for high voltage transformer. Mineral oil is obtained from petroleum through distillation processes. Petroleum is known as non-renewable resources and non-biodegradable. The flash point of mineral oil is around 150°C, thus it creates a problem for high temperature condition.

It is biodegradable, non-toxic, non-flammable, and has a higher breakdown voltage. However, the viscosity of vegetable oil is high so that further treatment is needed in order to reduce the viscosity of the oil.

The alkyl ester can be obtained from the reaction of triglycerides, alcohol and strong base as a catalyst. The by-product, which is glycerol, is then separated from the oil by using gravitational method as its density is higher than the natural ester oil.

 Power transformer is an important equipment to transport and deliver the electric energy in the power system. It will result in huge damage of national economy while the transformers break down. On-line monitoring the dissolved gases in oil is one of the effective methods to improve the security and reliability of the power system. CO is the one of main failure characteristic gases in the transformer oil. It's significant to monitor on-line and analyze CO gas for the power transformer's safe operation. The key of on-line monitoring is the gas sensor technology. One-dimensional (1D) semiconductor metal oxide nanostructures have attracted increasing attention in electrochemistry, optics, magnetic, and gas sensing fields for the good properties. N-type low dimensional semiconducting oxides such as SnO2 and ZnO have been known for the detection of inflammable or toxic gases. In this paper, we fabricated the ZnO-SnO2 and SnO2 nanoparticles by hydrothermal synthesis. Microstructure characterization was performed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and surface morphologies for both the pristine and doped samples were observed using field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Then we made thin film gas sensor to study the gas sensing properties of ZnO-SnO2 and SnO2 gas sensor to CO. A systematic comparison study reveals an enhanced gas sensing performance for the sensor made of SnO2 and ZnO towards CO over that of the commonly applied undecorated SnO2 nanoparticles. The improved gas sensing properties are attributed to the size of grains and pronounced electron transfer between the compound nanostructures and the absorbed oxygen species as well as to the heterojunctions of the ZnO nanoparticles to the SnO2 nanoparticles, which provide additional reaction rooms. The results represent an advance of compound nanostructures in further enhancing the functionality of gas sensors, and this facile method could be applicable to many sensing materials, offering a new avenue and direction to detect gases of interest based on composite tin oxide nanoparticles.","Li QZ,Chen WG,Gao TY,Gan HL",,,Gas sensing properties of ZnO-SnO2 nanostructures towards CO in transformer oil,,,10.1109/ICHVE.2014.7035461 , Conference Paper,2014,"Power transformer is an important equipment to transport and deliver the electric energy in the power system.

 As important and widely used electrical equipment, GIS (gas insulated switchgear)greatly affects the stability and safety of the entire power grid due to its working state and performance. When a partial discharge or local overheating occurs inside the GIS, SF6will decompose and produce various by-products (including SO2, SO2F2, COS, H2S, SOF2 and etc) that are toxic and corrosive. The reduction of SF6 gas concentration and the generation of corrosive gases will lead to a decrease in the internal insulation strength of GIS. By monitoring the concentration of SF6in GIS, it can help us to judge the operating status of GIS and prevent fault. In this paper, we build a gas Raman spectroscopy gas detection platform. The light source of the detection platform is a solid-state laser with a wavelength of 532nm and a laser power of 1.5W. A self-designed gas cell is used to contain the gas to be measured. A spectrometer and CCD are used to collect Raman signals. Based on this Raman spectroscopy gas detection platform, a Raman spectroscopy study of SF6was carried out. Under 1 atmosphere pressure, Based on the built Raman detection platform, Raman spectroscopy of SF6with a concentration of 99.99% was obtained. By analyzing the Raman spectroscopy obtained, the characteristic Raman spectral lines of SF6was determined as 774cm-1. And the Raman spectroscopy of SF6 under the pressure of gradient distribution was obtained. The Raman spectra of SF6with gradient pressure, laser power were obtained. By analyzing the Raman spectroscopy of SF6obtained under different pressure and laser power, it is found that the characteristic peak intensity of Raman of SF6is highly linear with pressure and laser power. The highly linear relationship between the Raman peak intensity of SF6and various conditions shows that Raman spectroscopy has great advantages in the quantitative analysis of SF6.

 Implantable biomedical actuators are highly desired in modern medicine. However, how to power up these biomedical implants remains a challenge since most of them need more than several hundreds mW of power. The air-core based radio-frequency transformer (two face-to-face inductive coils) has been the only non-toxic and non-invasive power source for implants for the last three decades [1].

Also, the delivered power is highly vulnerable to the coils' geometrical arrangement and the electrical property of the medium around them. In this paper, a novel rotating-magnets based wireless power transfer that can deliver ∼10 W over 1 cm is demonstrated. The delivered power is significantly higher than the existing start-of-art.

(2) In the case of liquids which are contaminated by PCBs, the first two disposal choices involve either destruction, by a combustion method or disposal in a chemical waste landfill. However, it is sometimes possible to reclaim the liquid for re-use. This paper discusses the numerous alternative chemical methods of PCB destruction as well as the physical separation of PCBs to yield uncontaminated liquids.",2576-702X,,,, ,1982 Annual Meeting Industry Applications Society  ,,out_of_scope,

 In the past decades, the application of nanostructures and nanotechnology has attracted intensive attention in many fields from electronic devices to chemical sensors. The monitoring of toxic or inflammable gases has been increasingly important for humans, environment and various areas. In the power system field, power transformers are important equipment of electricity transmission and distribution, and its operation condition is associated with the safety of power system.

 Natural esters derived from natural plants are being considered as potential substitutes to conventional mineral oils, due to their less-flammable, non-toxic and environmentally friendly properties. To date, natural esters have been successfully applied in sealed distribution, traction transformers and even a few cases in power transformers. But the fact of being susceptible to oxidation presents it still an engineering challenge of replacing mineral oil by natural esters in those free-breathing transformers. At present, the most commonly used antioxidant in natural esters is BHT, but its non-degradability also brings a big problem. In this paper, different biodegradable antioxidants were added into natural esters and liquid samples filled into specially designed test cells with a volume/surface ratio of 20 mm. The liquid samples in the test cell were aged in an air-circulating oven at 120°C. AC breakdown strength (kV/mm) of the liquid samples was measured periodically during the accelerated ageing experiment. Acid value of the liquid samples was also measured to provide additional information.

 Mineral oil from petroleum crude has been used in Transformers and Reactors since 1890s.

Further, gas to liquid technology has also been evolved in recent times for mineral oils.

 Environmental pollutants have become a major global concern. The waste generated from the development of products and processes are of concern to the environmentalist. One of the major issues in recent times is the threat to the human life caused due to the progressive deterioration of the environment. The waste generated from the development of products and processes are of concern to the environmentalist. Heavy metals are also reported persisting into the environment causing toxicity to living organisms through bioaccumulation, adsorption and biotransformation. A number of microorganisms, as a result of their versatility, adaptability and diversity in the environment, are considered to be the best candidates among all living organisms to remediate most of the environmental contaminants into the natural biogeochemical cycle. These natural forces of biodegradation can reduce waste and cleanup some types of environmental contaminants. Compositing can accelerate natural biodegradation and convert organic wastes to valuable resources. Deinococcus radiodurans is known as the world's toughest bacteria and it is the most radiation resistant organism known. Scientists are interested in this organism because of its potential usefulness in cleaning up waste sites that contain radiation and toxic chemicals. It can tolerate radiation levels at 1000 times the levels that would kill a human and it was originally isolated in 1956 from a can of meat that had been irradiated with X-rays. The bacterium can tolerate high levels of chemical, oxidative, UV, and ionizing radiation-induced damage to the cell's DNA, which it efficiently repairs. The resistance to radiation may reflect its resistance to dessication, which also causes DNA damage. This organism may be of use in cleaning up toxic metals found at nuclear weapons production sites due to the radiation resistance. Deinococcus has been genetically engineered for use in bioremediation to consume and digest solvents and heavy metals, even in a highly radioactive site. For example, the bacterial mercuric reductase gene has been cloned from Escherichia coli into Deinococcus to detoxify the ionic mercury residue frequently found in radioactive waste generated from nuclear weapons manufacture. This bacterium is also a highly efficient transformer, and can readily take up exogenous DNA from the environment, which may also aid DNA repair. Bioinformatics offers many interesting possibilities for bioremediation from environment protection point of view. Genomic and bioinformatic data provide a wealth of information that would be greatly enhanced by structural characterisation of some of these proteins in them. It can be extended to follow the leads provided by collaborating bioinformatics experts and proteomics studies. This may ultimately result not only in a more complete understanding of the radiation resistance of this bacterium, but also to the discovery of novel DNA repair systems, applicable to an understanding of the mechanisms of higher organisms such as man. Analysis of paralogs in Deinococcus has revealed several unique protein families. In addition, specific expansions of several other families including phosphatases, proteases, acyltransferases, and Nudix family pyrophosphohydrolases were detected.

These observations suggest that several different biological mechanisms contribute to the multiple DNA repair-dependent phenotypes of this organism.

 Highly biodegradable and renewable seed-based oils can be an alternative source of dielectric fluids to replace the non-friendly mineral oil-based dielectric fluids. However, the high moisture content of vegetable oils is not suitable for a viable dielectric fluid formulation for safe, economic and trouble free operation of power and distribution transformers.

The paper also presents the acute toxicity and biodegradation characteristics of the processed vegetable oil-based base fluid to demonstrate its environmental compliance. Experimental results of de-moisturisation using some absorbing materials indicate that the moisture level of vegetable oils can be reduced below the bench marked level to ensure the functional behaviour of vegetable oil-based dielectric fluids.

 Printed Electronics (PE) feature distinct and remarkable characteristics that make them a prominent technology for achieving true ubiquitous computing. This is particularly relevant in application domains that require conformal and ultra-low cost solutions, which have experienced limited penetration of computing until now. Unlike silicon-based technologies, PE offer unparalleled features such as non-recurring engineering costs, ultra-low manufacturing cost, and on-demand fabrication of conformal, flexible, non-toxic, and stretchable hardware. However, PE face certain limitations due to their large feature sizes, that impede the realization of complex circuits, such as machine learning classifiers.

 As people have become more aware of their actions and how they affect their surroundings, they have realized the dire state of the environment. As a result, the recycling movement has gained momentum as a measure to save it. Contemporarily, the recycling industry has not seen a major shift and the problems that existed decades earlier persist. Trash classification is at the core of these problems, because if you can’t classify it, obviously you can’t recycle it. Manual classification often leads to misclassification as humans classify or judge things based on their experiences, knowledge, and not just absolute facts. Additionally, if the waste to be sorted is toxic, being in direct contact may be physically harmful to the people involved. Until a solution is found for this problem, the recycling industry won’t be on par with the rise in recycling culture. Thus, this is the problem we have set out to solve; this paper proposes a Deep Learning model based on EfficientNet Architecture that can classify different kinds of trash with an accuracy high enough to make it a viable solution for the industry while using a comparatively lower number of parameters than existing methods.

 In minimal invasive image guided catheterization procedures, physicians require information of the catheter position with respect to the patient's vasculature. However, in fluoroscopic images, visualization of the vasculature requires toxic contrast agent. Static vasculature roadmapping, which can reduce the usage of iodine contrast, is hampered by the breathing motion in abdominal catheterization. In this paper, we propose a method to track the catheter tip inside the patient's 3D vessel tree using intra-operative single-plane 2D X-ray image sequences and a peri-operative 3D rotational angiography (3DRA). The method is based on a hidden Markov model (HMM) where states of the model are the possible positions of the catheter tip inside the 3D vessel tree. The transitions from state to state model the probabilities for the catheter tip to move from one position to another. The HMM is updated following the observation scores, based on the registration between the 2D catheter centerline extracted from the 2D X-ray image, and the 2D projection of 3D vessel tree centerline extracted from the 3DRA. The method is extensively evaluated on simulated and clinical datasets acquired during liver abdominal catheterization. The evaluations show a median 3D tip tracking error of 2.3 mm with optimal settings in simulated data. The registered vessels close to the tip have a median distance error of 4.7 mm with angiographic data and optimal settings.

Previous work in this area chooses queries sequentially based on Information gain, and the object states are inferred by maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. In this work, rather than MAP estimation, we aim to rank objects according to their posterior fault probability. We propose a greedy algorithm to choose queries sequentially by maximizing the area under the ROC curve associated with the ranked list. The proposed algorithm overcomes limitations of existing work. When multiple faults may be present, the proposed algorithm does not rely on belief propagation, making it feasible for large scale networks with little loss in performance.

 Over the past few decades, air pollution has emerged as a significant environmental hazard, causing premature deaths in Southeast Asia. The proliferation of industrialization and deforestation has resulted in an alarming increase in pollution levels. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly reduced the amount of volatile organic compounds and toxic gases in the air due to the decrease in human activity caused by lockdowns and restrictions. This study aims to investigate the air quality in various geographical areas of Bangladesh, comparing the air quality index (AQI) during different lockdown periods to equivalent eight-year time spans in 10 of the country’s busiest cities. This study demonstrates a strong correlation between the rapid and widespread dispersion of COVID-19 and air pollution reduction in Bangladesh. In addition, we evaluated the performance of Support Vector Regression (SVR) in AQI forecasting using the time series dataset.

 Stress is a natural human reaction to demands or pressure, usually when perceived as harmful or/and toxic. When stress becomes constantly overwhelmed and prolonged, it increases the risk of mental health and physiological uneasiness. Furthermore, chronic stress raises the likelihood of mental health plagues such as anxiety, depression, and sleep disorder. Although measuring stress using physiological parameters such as heart rate variability (HRV) is a common approach, how to achieve ultra-high accuracy based on HRV measurements remains as a challenging task. HRV is not equivalent to heart rate. While heart rate is the average value of heartbeats per minute, HRV represents the variation of the time interval between successive heartbeats. The HRV measurements are related to the variance of RR intervals which stand for the time between successive R peaks. In this study, we investigate the role of HRV features as stress detection bio-markers and develop a machine learning-based model for multi-class stress detection. More specifically, a convolution neural network (CNN) based model is developed to detect multi-class stress, namely, no stress, interruption stress, and time pressure stress, based on both time- and frequency-domain features of HRV. Validated through a publicly available dataset, SWELL–KW, the achieved accuracy score of our model has reached 99.9% (Precision = 1, Recall = 1, $F1-$ score = 1, and MCC = 0.99), thus outperforming the existing methods in the literature.

Hence, the challenge is to identify what exactly is exhibited in comments so that respective policies can be formulated and applied to penalize the offender.

 One paramount challenge in multi-ion-sensing arises from ion interference that degrades the accuracy of sensor calibration. Machine learning models are here proposed to optimize such multivariate calibration. However, the acquisition of big experimental data is time and resource consuming in practice, necessitating new paradigms and efficient models for these data-limited frameworks. Therefore, a novel approach is presented in this work, where a multi-ion-sensing emulator is designed to explain the response of an ion-sensing array in a mixed-ion environment. A case study is performed emulating the concurrent monitoring of sodium, potassium, lithium, and lead ions, in a medium representative of sweat samples. These analytes are relevant examples of sweat ion-sensing applications for physiology, therapeutic drug monitoring, and heavy metal contamination. It is demonstrated that calibration datasets output by the emulator explain accurately the experimental response of polymeric solid-contact ion-selective electrodes, where root-mean-squared error of 1.37, 1.44, 1.78, 2 mV are obtained, respectively, for Na+, K+, Li+, Pb2+ sensor calibration in artificial sweat.

 Plant diseases are a major threat to farmers, consumers, environment and the global economy. In India alone, 35% of field crops are lost to pathogens and pests causing losses to farmers. Indiscriminate use of pesticides is also a serious health concern as many are toxic and biomagnified. These adverse effects can be avoided by early disease detection, crop surveillance and targeted treatments. Most diseases are diagnosed by agricultural experts by examining external symptoms. However, farmers have limited access to experts. Our project is the first integrated and collaborative platform for automated disease diagnosis, tracking and forecasting. Farmers can instantly and accurately identify diseases and get solutions with a mobile app by photographing affected plant parts. Real-time diagnosis is enabled using the latest Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms for Cloud-based image processing. The AI model continuously learns from user uploaded images and expert suggestions to enhance its accuracy. Farmers can also interact with local experts through the platform. For preventive measures, disease density maps with spread forecasting are rendered from a Cloud based repository of geo-tagged images and micro-climactic factors. A web interface allows experts to perform disease analytics with geographical visualizations. In our experiments, the AI model (CNN) was trained with large disease datasets, created with plant images self-collected from many farms over 7 months.

 Federated learning is exposed to model poisoning attacks as compromised clients may submit malicious model updates to pollute the global model.

 In the 21st century, the advancements of computing, Internet of Things and wireless communications are enabling mining companies to collect a vast amount of datasets during risk management. Multipurpose sensors installed at many locations in underground mining environment provide data about the safety, security and mine conditions in near realtime. However, it is more important to convert this data into strategic intelligence, which means the communication of the right information to the right people at the right time to enable them to make optimal and informed decisions on risk control and process optimization. The Sterkfontein caves is a world heritage site, and over the past few years, some deformation was recorded inside the caves. Possible reasons include urbanization in the surrounding area, illegal dolomite mining in the past, weathering, man-made archaeological activities and continuous pouring of polluted and acidic water into the caves system. Acid water has high potential to dissolve the sensitive dolomite, create new and enlarge existing rock cavities, which can destabilize rock formations.

 Cyanobacteria, an ancient type of photosynthetic microbe, inhabit most fresh and marine water on Earth.

Rapid and accurate identification of cyanobacteria is essential for population monitoring and mitigation efforts, especially when cyanobacteria produce toxins, threatening the health of wildlife and humans. However, the diverse shapes and appearances of cyanobacteria render manual identification time-consuming and error-prone.

Additionally, we propose numerous methods of addressing limited dataset size and image heterogeneity. We use various image pre-processing techniques, including color-preserving CLAHE. We also construct a comprehensive dataset containing several genera of cyanobacteria by supplementing laboratory images with opensource database images for training and evaluation.

 Molecular communication (MC) inspired drug delivery holds considerable promise as a new design for targeted therapy with high efficiency and minimal toxicity. The process of drug delivery can be modelled in a blood flow-based MC system, where nanoparticles (NPs) carry therapeutic agents through the blood vessel channels to the targeted diseased tissue. Most previous studies in the flow-based MC consider a Newtonian fluid with a laminar flow, which ignores the influence of red blood cells (RBCs). However, the nature of blood flow is a complex and non-Newtonian fluid composed of proteins, platelets, plasma and deformable cells, especially RBCs. The ability to change their shapes is essential to the proper functioning of RBCs in the microvasculature. Different shapes of RBCs have a great impact on the performance of blood flow. Changes in the properties and shapes of RBCs are often associated with different diseases, such as sickle cell anemia, diabetes, and malaria. Thus, it is highly important to establish a more realistic blood flow MC model considering the deformable cells.

6917,"Title:Deep Learning for Multi-Labeled Cyberbully Detection: Enhancing Online Safety

 Social media platforms offer undeniable benefits, but the preservation of anonymity has led to the emergence of cyberbullying, a concerning social problem. This form of online harassment creates a negative and hostile environment, resulting in decreased user engagement and psychological harm to victims. According to ResearchGate and ScienceDaily, cyberbullying victims in the United States are 1.9 times more likely to commit suicide, highlighting the severity of the issue. However, the current research on cyberbullying detection has been limited to binary/multi-class text classification due to the lack of comprehensive datasets for training and evaluation. To address this gap, we developed a DL-based multi-labeled cyberbully detection system using a dataset of 95,608 social media comments. These comments were categorized into five distinct multi-labeled classes, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of the different dimensions of cyberbullying. We utilized DL architectures, such as LSTM, BiLSTM, CLSTM, and BiGRU, to develop advanced cyberbully detection systems. By comparing the performance of these DL models with the ML models, we were able to assess the effectiveness and superiority of DL approaches in accurately identifying instances of cyberbullying contents.

This form of online harassment creates a negative and hostile environment, resulting in decreased user engagement and psychological harm to victims. According to ResearchGate and ScienceDaily, cyberbullying victims in the United States are 1.9 times more likely to commit suicide, highlighting the severity of the issue. However, the current research on cyberbullying detection has been limited to binary/multi-class text classification due to the lack of comprehensive datasets for training and evaluation. To address this gap, we developed a DL-based multi-labeled cyberbully detection system using a dataset of 95,608 social media comments. These comments were categorized into five distinct multi-labeled classes, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of the different dimensions of cyberbullying. We utilized DL architectures, such as LSTM, BiLSTM, CLSTM, and BiGRU, to develop advanced cyberbully detection systems. By comparing the performance of these DL models with the ML models, we were able to assess the effectiveness and superiority of DL approaches in accurately identifying instances of cyberbullying contents.

Behavioral readouts are increasingly used to assess the effects of compounds on the nervous system. Early stage zebrafish show characteristic behavioral features at stages between 30 and 42 hours post fertilization (hpf) when exposed to a short and bright light flash. This so-called Photomotor Response (PMR) is a reaction of the nervous system of the fish and can be used as a marker in screenings for neuroactive chemicals.

 Among a variety of sensing mechanisms and device architectures, field effect transistors (FETs) based devices are ideal biosensors that can directly convert interactions of biomolecules to electrical signals for low cost, rapid, label free, and sensitive detection. Si-based MOSFETs (planar or nanowire) have the great advantage of compatibility to the current microelectronic manufacturing processes, but suffer from current drift due to ion diffusion into the gate oxide layer, making them difficult to detect target analytes at low concentrations in physiological buffers or fluids with high ionic strengths. III-nitride semiconductors have attracted considerable interests for biosensor applications due to their unique properties, such as chemical inertness, non-toxicity, and thermal stability. Especially, III-nitrides FETs are ion-impermeable and highly stable in electrolytic solutions, making them ideal for detection at ultralow concentration in fluids with high ionic strengths. Theoretical calculations suggest that nanowire and quantum dot FETs should have higher sensitivity than planar FETs due to the large surface to volume ratio.

 Recent years have seen exponential growth in the volume of data generated. An undesirable consequence of this rapid expansion is the alarming rise of misinformation that is spreading throughout social networks and publishing platforms. Fact verification is the act of verifying the correctness of a particular statement. Manual fact-checkers find it increasingly difficult to keep up with the rapid proliferation of fake news in the information ecosystem. Fact verification pipelines aim at assisting the fact-checkers. These pipelines involve retrieving potentially relevant documents for a given claim, checking the reliability of the document media sources, evaluating the significance of each document, and verifying the correctness of given claims. However, there are a few limitations to these pipelines. The first limitation is that they treat fact verification as a stance detection or textual entailment task and places less emphasis on pure reasoning as the basis of fact verification. The second limitation is the robustness of the models. The fact verification models do not perform well on real-world data due to the text constructed using a myriad of complex ways. The reason for low accuracy is due to the evaluation and training of models on synthetic data that does not resemble the real-world data. In this paper, we present EnFVe, an end-to-end pipeline that integrates various components of fact verification. EnFVe pipeline improves upon the existing pipelines by integrating: (1) a Data Acquisition module that routinely scrapes data for constructing and updating the ground truth, (2) Preprocessing modules such as Coreference Resolution and Sentence Simplification that improves the robustness of the verification, (3) a Continuous Retrieval Engine module that captures the semantic context of the text, and (4) an Ensemble module that consists of various state-of-the-art fact verification models equipped with hyperparameter optimization.

These pipelines involve retrieving potentially relevant documents for a given claim, checking the reliability of the document media sources, evaluating the significance of each document, and verifying the correctness of given claims. However, there are a few limitations to these pipelines. The first limitation is that they treat fact verification as a stance detection or textual entailment task and places less emphasis on pure reasoning as the basis of fact verification. The second limitation is the robustness of the models. The fact verification models do not perform well on real-world data due to the text constructed using a myriad of complex ways. The reason for low accuracy is due to the evaluation and training of models on synthetic data that does not resemble the real-world data. In this paper, we present EnFVe, an end-to-end pipeline that integrates various components of fact verification. EnFVe pipeline improves upon the existing pipelines by integrating: (1) a Data Acquisition module that routinely scrapes data for constructing and updating the ground truth, (2) Preprocessing modules such as Coreference Resolution and Sentence Simplification that improves the robustness of the verification, (3) a Continuous Retrieval Engine module that captures the semantic context of the text, and (4) an Ensemble module that consists of various state-of-the-art fact verification models equipped with hyperparameter optimization. EnFVe achieves an accuracy of (dev/test) 79.26%/73.28%, which is better as compared to the state-of-the-art fact verification pipelines.",,,,, ,  2020 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Joint Conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology (WI-IAT),,out_of_scope,

 Lead (Pb) is a highly toxic metal that tends to accumulate in the body. The complexes of lead are very stable within the body and cannot be metabolized or degraded rapidly, leading to lead toxicity. Therefore, it is important to detect low levels of lead in the environment to prevent lead poisoning in humans. The detection of Pb2+ ions at the nanomolar and micromolar level is achieved using DNA aptamers and quantum dots. Pb2+ ions can be detected using a DNA aptamer known as thrombin binding aptamer (TBA), which folds into a G-quadruplex structure when lead is present. The conjugation of a quantum dot and a gold nanoparticle (AuNP) to the TBA allows for optical detection via fluorescence resonant energy transfer. In the aptamer probe discussed herein, the excited quantum dot fluoresces when the DNA is in a random coil configuration.

 Pharmaceuticals are a class of emerging micropollutants whose detection in surface waters have been attributed to domestic effluent discharges. Although concerns over potential ecological and health impacts have been raised for certain pharmaceutical groups (e.g., antibiotics), to date there are no discharge standards for these chemicals. Given that most ecotoxicity studies for pharmaceuticals were performed in laboratory settings that may differ from environmental conditions, there is a need to establish their actual environmental concentrations. In the current study, we performed a systematic review of literature to examine the influent sewage concentrations of erythromycin (prescription antibiotic) and ibuprofen (over-the counter pain reliever) in municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). The literature search and screening procedure yielded datasets from a total of 250 WWTPs which were grouped according to plant capacity (small, <; 10 mega gallons per day, MGD; medium, 10-100 MGD; and large, > 100 MGD) and geographic location (Asia, Europe, North America). Measured erythromycin levels in the influent ranged from 10-1 μ g/L to 1 μ g/L, while ibuprofen levels ranged from 10-1 μ g/L to 102 μ g/L. Average erythromycin levels were about the same across all WWTP sizes and regions. Average ibuprofen levels were significantly higher in small WWTPs than in large WWTPs ( ).

 Dimethylamine -((CH3)2N) (DMA), is one of the genotoxic highly volatile chemical compound that has significant biochemical effect on human genetic cells. In addition to the role of bio-marker in determining the fish freshness, dimethylamine is also used as a pre-cursor in many applications such as in the field of pesticides, dyes, plastics, etc., Therefore, to detect DMA at its early stage in commercial areas is of great importance in protecting the atmosphere as well as human health due to its irritability, combustibility, and toxicity. The reports on DMA sensing is in scarce and few reports that have been reported are at high temperature operation. Semiconducting metal-oxides are prominent material in chemical sensing due to its high sensitivity, faster response, and better stability. Hence, in the present work, vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) chemi-resistive sensor was developed to detect DMA vapours at room temperature for the minimum concentration of about 5 ppm. V2O5 nanoparticles were synthesized using hydrothermal technique and its structural information has been obtained from X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy techniques. The morphology of the synthesized nanoparticles exhibited porous structure that have been observed using scanning electron microscopy. The DMA sensing studies have been carried out in a custom-made vapour sensing chamber at ambient temperature and relative humidity (25°C and 37%) for various concentrations of DMA and its sensor response (S) was calculated.

 SF6 in the faulty gas insulation equipment can be resolved into low-fluoride sulfide under the effect of high energy. Some of them such as SF2, S2F2, SF4, SOF2, SOF4 are easy to take hydrolysis and alkaline reactions, and some such as SO2F2, are able to occur partially alkaline reactions, and some are almost impossible to decompose such as S2F10, S2F10O and so on. The total amount of low-fluoride sulfide which can undergo hydrolysis and alkaline reactions in SF6 could be determined by hydrolysis fluoride. Therefore, if the content of hydrolyzable fluoride is found to be significantly higher than its initial value, some internal faults may exist in the equipment.

As a result, the water extracts of indoor and outdoor aerosol samples significantly reduced the bioluminescence of Vibrio fischeri and the inhibition per sampling volume increased with increasing TSP concentrations. The inhibition per unit mass of the indoor aerosols became greater than that of outdoor aerosols, when increasing in air change rate. The inhibition tended to correlate with nitrate and sulfate concentrations in the extracts. This study showed possible application of bioassay to the monitoring of indoor suspended particle contamination.",,,,, ,  2009 ICCAS-SICE,,out_of_scope,

 Online code clones are code fragments that are copied from software projects or online sources to Stack Overflow as examples. Due to an absence of a checking mechanism after the code has been copied to Stack Overflow, they can become toxic code snippets, e.g., they suffer from being outdated or violating the original software license. We present a study of online code clones on Stack Overflow and their toxicity by incorporating two developer surveys and a large-scale code clone detection. A survey of 201 high-reputation Stack Overflow answerers (33 percent response rate) showed that 131 participants (65 percent) have ever been notified of outdated code and 26 of them (20 percent) rarely or never fix the code. 138 answerers (69 percent) never check for licensing conflicts between their copied code snippets and Stack Overflow's CC BY-SA 3.0. A survey of 87 Stack Overflow visitors shows that they experienced several issues from Stack Overflow answers: mismatched solutions, outdated solutions, incorrect solutions, and buggy code. 85 percent of them are not aware of CC BY-SA 3.0 license enforced by Stack Overflow, and 66 percent never check for license conflicts when reusing code snippets.

Therefore, building upon the aforementioned task and predicting if a tweet will incite hate speech is of critical importance.

 Discovering unknown adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in postmarketing surveillance as early as possible is of great importance.

We propose a novel team-based intelligent agent software system approach for proactively monitoring and detecting potential ADRs of interest using electronic patient records.

The intelligent agents, operating on computers located in different places, are capable of continuously and autonomously collaborating with each other and assisting the human users (e.g., the food and drug administration (FDA), drug safety professionals, and physicians). The agents should enhance current systems and accelerate early ADR identification. To evaluate the performance of the ADRMonitor with respect to the current spontaneous reporting approach, we conducted simulation experiments on identification of ADR signal pairs (i.e., potential links between drugs and apparent adverse reactions) under various conditions. The experiments involved over 275 000 simulated patients created on the basis of more than 1000 real patients treated by the drug cisapride that was on the market for seven years until its withdrawal by the FDA in 2000 due to serious ADRs.

 Strychnos nux-vomica has been used as a poisonous raw material for the preparation of Chinese medicinal herb for thousands of years in China, it is required that the herb should be specially processed before being put into clinical use. Since its treatment dosage is very close to its toxic dosage, poisoning frequently take place due to misuse, brucine and its derivatives are the principal component responsible for its pharmacodynamic effect and toxicity, strychnine is main component responsible for its toxicity. Both strychnine and brucine are typical antagonists of the glycine receptors on postsynatic membrane. Its toxic effects are mainly to cause central excitation. Because of its strong toxicity, narrow safety range and cumulative effect, the use of the drug in the clinical practice tends to cause poisoning, and poisoning of the drug is associated with the large dosage, and/or the long time use. Its toxicity also varies with its origins of production or batches. The symptoms of strychnos nuxvomica poisoning vary. The autopsy findings mainly include pathological changes caused by acute disorder of blood circulation, characterized by the congestion and edema of organs or pinpoint bleeding of mucosa or serous membrane. Long-term toxicity test revealed no characteristic pathological changes of vital organs in animals.

Since its treatment dosage is very close to its toxic dosage, poisoning frequently take place due to misuse, brucine and its derivatives are the principal component responsible for its pharmacodynamic effect and toxicity, strychnine is main component responsible for its toxicity. Both strychnine and brucine are typical antagonists of the glycine receptors on postsynatic membrane. Its toxic effects are mainly to cause central excitation. Because of its strong toxicity, narrow safety range and cumulative effect, the use of the drug in the clinical practice tends to cause poisoning, and poisoning of the drug is associated with the large dosage, and/or the long time use. Its toxicity also varies with its origins of production or batches. The symptoms of strychnos nuxvomica poisoning vary. The autopsy findings mainly include pathological changes caused by acute disorder of blood circulation, characterized by the congestion and edema of organs or pinpoint bleeding of mucosa or serous membrane.

At present, in the agricultural sectors, diagnosing the type disease of plants are based on human expert, which is alongside with the conventional method applied using test device and performing laboratory test. Therefore, the needs in new approach to classify type of diseases are preferable. Hence, the aim of this paper is to focus on an innovative method based on image processing technique for classifying the lack of nutritional disease occurred in oil palm leaves by analyzing the leave surface only. The result is usable as a guide for fertilization since the trees respond rapidly to the applied fertilizers. The main important concern is to ensure the sufficient amount of fertilizer since excessive intake of fertilizers will cause toxicity to trees and indirectly increase cost of fertilizers. Images of oil palm leaves will be captured using high-end digital imaging device to analyse the leaves surface.

 Summary form only given. The threat of chemical and biological attack is becoming increasingly more likely. Since the liver metabolizes xenobiotic species, construction of a liver tissue based biosensor allows the detection of a wide range of harmful agents by detecting physiological changes in cultured liver cells. Previously, the development of such technology has been limited since traditional 2D culturing methods lead to dedifferentiation and loss of hepatic functions within hours to days. By recreating a 3D culture environment similar to the acinus in the liver, maintenance of differentiated hepatic functions such as albumin secretion, urea synthesis and cytochrome p450 1A1 production has been demonstrated for culture periods over 14 days. Measurement of cytochrome p450 1A1 through ethoxyresorufin dealkylation (EROD) was adapted for use as a diagnostic to optically assess toxicity of probe compounds. Detection by both spectroscopy and 2-photon microscopy was developed to allow temporal as well morphological exploration of toxicity. These methods were used to successfully detect both aflatoxin B1, and microcystin LR. For microcystin, a five fold decrease in EROD intensity was observed within 12 hours. For aflatoxin toxicity was sensed by 15 hours for doses as low as 12 nM.

 In vivo direct drug targeting aims at delivering drug molecules loaded on microrobots to the diseased site using the shortest possible physiological routes, which potentially improves targeting efficiency and reduces systemic toxicity. It is thus essential to consider realistic in-body limitations for direct drug targeting applications. Here, we present a novel controller for microrobot maneuver by considering four key in vivo constraints: non-Euclidean structure of capillaries, irreversibility of blood flow, invisibility of microvasculature, and inaccuracy of microrobot tracking. We use the taxicab geometry of capillaries as the a priori knowledge for steering and tracking a microrobot in lattice-like vessels. Furthermore, we introduce a minimax repulsive boundary function to prevent the microrobot from getting too close to the boundaries imposed by the direction of blood flow. We also propose a novel Kalman filtering algorithm to reduce tracking error, while avoiding possible obstacles such as vessel walls without knowing their actual locations. The proposed control method consists of four modules, namely a model predictive control module for tumor targeting, a Kalman filtering module for microrobot tracking, a blind obstacle detection module, and a vessel structure estimation module.

 Three-dimensional engineered heart tissues (EHTs) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have become an important resource for both drug toxicity screening and research on heart disease. A key metric of EHT phenotype is the contractile (twitch) force with which the tissue spontaneously beats. It is well-known that cardiac muscle contractility – its ability to do mechanical work – depends on tissue prestrain (preload) and external resistance (afterload). Objectives: Here, we demonstrate a technique to control afterload while monitoring contractile force exerted by EHTs. Methods: We developed an apparatus that can regulate EHT boundary conditions using real-time feedback control. The system is comprised of a pair of piezoelectric actuators that can strain the scaffold and a microscope that can measure EHT force and length. Closed loop control allows dynamic regulation of effective EHT boundary stiffness. Results: When controlled to switch instantaneously from auxotonic to isometric boundary conditions, EHT twitch force immediately doubled. Changes in EHT twitch force as a function of effective boundary stiffness were characterized and compared to twitch force in auxotonic conditions. Conclusion: EHT contractility can be regulated dynamically through feedback control of effective boundary stiffness.

 The exponential growth of social media platforms has brought about a revolution in communication and content dissemination in human society. Nevertheless, these platforms are being increasingly misused to spread toxic content, including hate speech, malicious advertising, and pornography, leading to severe negative consequences such as harm to teenagers' mental health. Despite tremendous efforts in developing and deploying textual and image content moderation methods, malicious users can evade moderation by embedding texts into images, such as screenshots of the text, usually with some interference. We find that modern content moderation software's performance against such malicious inputs remains underexplored. In this work, we propose OASIS, a metamorphic testing framework for content moderation software. OASIS employs 21 transform rules summarized from our pilot study on 5,000 real-world toxic contents collected from 4 popular social media applications, including Twitter, Instagram, Sina Weibo, and Baidu Tieba. Given toxic textual contents, OASIS can generate image test cases, which preserve the toxicity yet are likely to bypass moderation. In the evaluation, we employ OASIS to test five commercial textual content moderation software from famous companies (i.e., Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, Baidu Cloud, Alibaba Cloud and Tencent Cloud), as well as a state-of-the-art moderation research model.

 This research activity concerns the development of a sensor based on Sansevieria plants to measure UV-A radiation. The proposed approach is based on soils and plants together with the metabolic processes and bacterial activities involved in such organisms. This generation of devices aims to overcome silicon-based solutions that cause environmental pollution with CO2 emissions during manufacturing and issues of nonbiodegradability and toxicity at the dissemination or end-of-life phases.

 Sulfur mustard (SM), a chemical warfare agent (CWA) is a bifunctional blistering and alkylating agent used in military warfare having antimitotic, mutagenic, carcinogenic, teratogenic and cytotoxic effects.

Biosensors offer an alternative analytical approach with a promise of selectivity in addition to sensitivity, ease of use, rapid response and negligible sample pre-treatment. Furthermore, biomolecules have the ability to detect toxicity in addition to concentration.

For this, chlorophyll extract from a plant source was immobilized on fibre glass discs of 5mm diameter, and its fluorescence was studied by excitation at 437 nm and emission at 667 nm. The exposure of the biocomponent to 2-CEES led to quenching of fluorescence, which varied linearly with increasing concentration of 2-CEES with a detection limit of 7.68 × 10−10 M. The fluorescence drop mechanism was characterized by HPLC studies which confirmed the conversion of chlorophyll, upon exposure to the analyte, to non-fluorescing catabolic products.

7020,"Title:Rapid quantification system for zinc in blood serum

 Pediatric septic shock is a major health problem in the United States, with 42,000 cases annually and an approximate 10% mortality rate. Studies have shown that pediatric septic shock patients regularly have critically low levels of serum zinc (Zn), suggesting oral supplementation of Zn as a therapeutic strategy. To protect patients, it is exceedingly important to monitor blood serum concentration of Zn during supplementation in order to ensure normal physiological levels and watch for heavy metal toxicity due to over supplementation. Current quantification methods typically involve the use of external laboratory facilities and turnaround times ranging from hours to days.

 In machine learning and molecular design, there exist two approaches: discriminative and generative. In the discriminative approach dubbed forward design, the goal is to map a set of features/molecules to their respective electronic properties. In the generative approach dubbed inverse design, a set of electronic properties is given and the goal is to find the features/molecules that have these properties. These tasks are very challenging because the chemical compound space is very large. In this study, we explore a new scheme for the inverse design of molecules based on a classification paradigm that takes as input the targeted electronic properties and output the atomic composition of the molecules (i.e. atomicity or atom counts of each type in a molecule). To test this new hypothesis, we analyzed the quantum mechanics QM7b dataset consisting of 7211 small organic molecules and 14 electronic properties. Results obtained using twenty three different classification approaches including a regularized Bayesian neural network show that it is possible to achieve detection/prediction accuracy> 90%.

 Recently, the use of MRI contrast agents has been proven to be substantially improved sensitivity and specificity in many clinical applications.

The use of contrast agents can improve lesion detection and characterization. The routinely used dose of contrast agents in the routine MRI examinations only relies on the weight of the subject. The purpose of this study is to obtain the clinically optimal dose for 3D-TOF (time-of-flight) pulse sequences for CE-MRA examinations. In the phantom study, ten test tubes were filled with saline mixed with different dose of Gd-DTPA. It is found that the optimal dose of Gd-DTPA for saline phantom by using 3D-TOF pulse sequences is 20 mM.

7034,"Title:Population dynamics and spatial distribution of phycotoxic microalgae associated with shellfish aquaculture sites in Nova Scotia

 Summary form only given. Coastal shellfish aquaculture sites are subject to seasonal blooms of toxic microalgae, which may result in restrictions on shellfish harvest due to human health risk. In southeastern Nova Scotia, such toxic episodes are uncommon, although significant numbers of putatively toxigenic phytoplankton are often found in the water column. In most coastal regions where diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) incidents have occurred, the events have been associated with blooms of species of the planktonic dinoflagellate Dinophysis. However, despite repeated attempts over several years, the authors have been unable to link the presence of DSP toxicity in Nova Scotian shellfish to the timing and magnitude of seasonal blooms of Dinophysis spp., even using sophisticated analytical techniques for toxin detection in size-fractionated planktonic material. Accordingly, the authors are now focusing on the epibenthic/epiphytic microalgal community associated with the suspended culture of bivalve shellfish in Mahone Bay, N.S., specifically blue mussels (Mytilus edulis). Loosely aggregated material (termed ""slub"") on shellfish lines was found to contain low levels of DSP toxins. Significant numbers of cells of a toxigenic epibenthic dinoflagellate, Prorocentrum lima were associated with the epiphytic macroalga Pilayella littoralis, a common fouling organism on suspended shellfish lines. Unialgal isolates of P. lima from this material were confirmed to produce DSP toxins in culture. Spirolides, a new class of biologically-active marine compounds, have also been identified within the digestive tissues of blue mussels and sea scallops from the east coast of Nova Scotia, including sites in Mahone Bay. The spatio-temporal distribution and seasonal occurrence (typically early May to July) of spirolides in shellfish strongly suggested a planktonic origin, and these compounds have been traced to specific size-fractions (predominately 20-50 /spl mu/m) of plankton from the upper water column. An unusual group of pigmented spherical cells (""golden balls""), with taxonomic affinities to certain gonyaulacoid dinoflagellates, are dominant in these fractions. To establish the role of attached and suspended particulate material surrounding shellfish aquaculture installations on phycotoxin transfer and feeding mechanisms, data were collected on standard oceanographic parameters (chlorophyll, inorganic nutrients, seston, POM/PIM, plankton composition and abundance, water column stratification). Preliminary studies with a high-resolution underwater photo-imaging system provided an extended time-series (48 h) of the vertical distribution of attached and suspended particulates (""marine snow""). The particle field immediately adjacent to the shellfish lines was clearly distinct from that of a nearby control site (30 m distant) and the phytoplankton composition was unrepresentative. This indicates a potentially serious bias in the application of conventional techniques for water column monitoring of toxigenic phytoplankton in nearshore coastal zones.","Cembella, A., Bauder, A., Lewis, N., Quilliam, M., Lawrence, J., Manuel, J., Lobsiger, U.",,,Population dynamics and spatial distribution of phycotoxic microalgae associated with shellfish aquaculture sites in Nova Scotia,,,10.1109/OCEANS.1997.634426 , ,1997,"Summary form only given.

Spirolides, a new class of biologically-active marine compounds, have also been identified within the digestive tissues of blue mussels and sea scallops from the east coast of Nova Scotia, including sites in Mahone Bay. The spatio-temporal distribution and seasonal occurrence (typically early May to July) of spirolides in shellfish strongly suggested a planktonic origin, and these compounds have been traced to specific size-fractions (predominately 20-50 /spl mu/m) of plankton from the upper water column. An unusual group of pigmented spherical cells (""golden balls""), with taxonomic affinities to certain gonyaulacoid dinoflagellates, are dominant in these fractions. To establish the role of attached and suspended particulate material surrounding shellfish aquaculture installations on phycotoxin transfer and feeding mechanisms, data were collected on standard oceanographic parameters (chlorophyll, inorganic nutrients, seston, POM/PIM, plankton composition and abundance, water column stratification). Preliminary studies with a high-resolution underwater photo-imaging system provided an extended time-series (48 h) of the vertical distribution of attached and suspended particulates (""marine snow""). The particle field immediately adjacent to the shellfish lines was clearly distinct from that of a nearby control site (30 m distant) and the phytoplankton composition was unrepresentative. This indicates a potentially serious bias in the application of conventional techniques for water column monitoring of toxigenic phytoplankton in nearshore coastal zones.",,,,, ,  Oceans '97.

To improve this, we introduce data augmentation on graphs (i.e. graph augmentation) and present four methods: random mapping, vertex-similarity mapping, motif-random mapping and motif-similarity mapping, to generate more weakly labeled data for small-scale benchmark datasets via heuristic transformation of graph structures. Furthermore, we propose a generic model evolution framework, named M-Evolve, which combines graph augmentation, data filtration and model retraining to optimize pre-trained graph classifiers. Experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework helps existing graph classification models alleviate over-fitting and undergeneralization in the training on small-scale benchmark datasets, which successfully yields an average improvement of 3-13% accuracy on graph classification tasks.","Zhou, Jiajun, Shen, Jie, Yu, Shanqing, Chen, Guanrong, Xuan, Qi",,,M-Evolve: Structural-Mapping-Based Data Augmentation for Graph Classification,,,10.1109/TNSE.2020.3032950 , ,2021,"Graph classification, which aims to identify the category labels of graphs, plays a significant role in drug classification, toxicity detection, protein analysis etc. However, the limitation of scale in the benchmark datasets makes it easy for graph classification models to fall into over-fitting and undergeneralization.

 Conventional management of cardiac arrythmias relies on oral drug therapy which minimizes recurrence of the arrhythmia, but risks unpleasant side effects and even long-term toxicity. The authors propose acute management instead, from an implanted drug pump which automatically senses the onset of arrhythmia, delivers a pharmacokinetically-based infusion to terminate the episode, and discontinues drug delivery until the next occurrence.

 This paper presents the outcomes of urban stormwater quality monitoring and research including associated activities in South East Queensland (SEQ). The issues associated with urban stormwater quality monitoring, ranging from automated field sampling to laboratory analysis of chemical, toxicological and microbiological constituents present in stormwater are elaborated. A medium density residential stormwater supply catchment of 290 hectares in northern Brisbane is presented as a case study and discussed in detail. Preliminary results indicate that the occurrence and concentration of chemical pollutants in urban stormwater runoff and the associated baseline toxicity is relatively low. However, the microbiological quality of stormwater may not be as good as initially perceived with high numbers of faecal indicator bacteria (FIB) detected during wet weather events. In addition, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of pathogens indicated the presence of human sewage contamination during wet weather events which might be due to potential sewer overflow events.

 The proper management of discarded electronic devices (often called electronic waste) is an emerging issue for solid waste professionals throughout the world because of the large growth of the waste stream, and the content of toxic metals in them, most notably heavy metals such as lead. Laptop computers are becoming one of the components of discarded electronic devices and will continue to increase in the waste stream in the future.

Our selection algorithm combines mathematical modelling of signal and its fold change distributions with the comprehensive effect size analysis. Thanks to the data-driven automated thresholding of the protein absolute or relative (fold change) expressions, and Cohens effect size based filters, the obtained proteomic signature demonstrated a higher level of consistency and functional coherency.

 Textile processing units largely employ azo dyes which are derivatives of benzene. Toxic sewage discharged from textile industries contains azo dyes.

 Fish is essentially one of the best sources of protein, economically and nutritional-wise, making it one of the favorites of Filipinos in their everyday meals. However, fishes are also easily perishable, especially when it gets stuck in traffic, further increasing the rate of decomposition of the fish as it is transported from the fish port to the local markets across the nation. There are several methods of preservation like icing, but there are also widespread reports regarding the adulteration of Formalin to the fish not only during transport but also its use in the wet markets nationwide to keep fish and other perishable products fresh. Formalin is used to increase the shelf life of fish to a certain extent, but its use provides a health risk to the consumer because it is a known carcinogenic chemical compound and can be toxic when consumed even on a very small amount approximately 0.00002% of the consumers weight. This paper is a study that used an electronic nose system in the detection of formalin specifically on fish samples.

However, fishes are also easily perishable, especially when it gets stuck in traffic, further increasing the rate of decomposition of the fish as it is transported from the fish port to the local markets across the nation. There are several methods of preservation like icing, but there are also widespread reports regarding the adulteration of Formalin to the fish not only during transport but also its use in the wet markets nationwide to keep fish and other perishable products fresh. Formalin is used to increase the shelf life of fish to a certain extent, but its use provides a health risk to the consumer because it is a known carcinogenic chemical compound and can be toxic when consumed even on a very small amount approximately 0.00002% of the consumers weight. This paper is a study that used an electronic nose system in the detection of formalin specifically on fish samples.

 This article presents an automated strategy to touch the injection site on zebrafish larva skin with the injection pipette tip accurately in the presence of water-depth variation, which is a crucial problem to automate zebrafish larva microinjection. The presented method consists of two parts: adaptive coordinate transformation and curve evolution for edge detection. In the first part, the impact of refraction is taken into consideration. An adaptive calibration method is developed, which enables the coordinate transformation matrix to adapt to the changing water depth. In the second part, the abovementioned calibration result is used to keep the injection pipette tip descending along the desired route. A curve-evolution-based edge detection algorithm is introduced to detect the deformation of larva skin caused by contact with the injection pipette tip. Experimental results demonstrate that high accuracy and success rates are achieved. The effect of uncertainties caused by water-depth variation and the skill requirement in manual manipulation are eliminated. The proposed contact detection strategy can be extended to microinjection for other organisms. Note to Practitioners—As a typical multicellular model organism, the zebrafish has been increasingly used in biological research. For studying drug toxicity and disease models, exogenous substances need to be injected into zebrafish larvae. However, for both manual and automated injection, a fatal problem is that the camera on the microscope only provides 2-D positional information. It is laborious to align the pipette tip with the injection site along the $z$ -axis. Moreover, due to the characteristic of stereomicroscopes, the impact of refraction at the water surface cannot be ignored.

However, in an edge computing deployment one cannot assume that resource-constrained end devices are sufficiently secure.

Then, differential privacy technology is leveraged to protect the privacy of both data and model in an edge computing setting. We also evaluate the detection performance in the presence of random and customized malicious end devices, and compare its performance with those of two other competing approaches published in IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing, in terms of attack resiliency, and communication and computation costs.

 Early diagnostics is a crucial part of clinical practice offering a rapid and convenient way to investigate and quantify the presence of key biomarkers related to specific pathologies and increasing the chance of successful treatments. In this regard, point-of-care testing (POCT) shows several advantages, enabling simple and rapid analyses, real-time results, and home-testing [1]. Metallic nanoparticles (NPs), like gold NPs (AuNPs), can be beneficially integrated into POC devices thanks to their tunable plasmonic properties, which provide naked-eye readout [2]. Moreover, the high sensitivity enabled by NPs allows the detection of biomarkers in non-invasive fluids where the concentrations are typically low. These biofluids, like saliva and urine, are functionally equivalent to serum in reflecting the physiological state of the body, whilst they are easier to handle, collect, and store [3]. In this work, we first reported the design and development of a colorimetric strategy based on the morphological change of multibranched plasmonic AuNPs, aimed at detecting glucose in saliva [4]. The sensing approach relied on a target-induced reshaping process, which involves the oxidation of the NP tips and the particle transformation into a spherical shape, characterized by a naked-eye detectable blue-to-pink color change. The platform proved to be beneficial in the early and non-invasive diagnosis of hyperglycemia. The successful technological transfer on a solid substrate paved the way for the realization of a dipstick prototype for home-testing. Then, the strategy was adapted to other biomarkers, leading to the development of a multiplexing test for the simultaneous detection of three salivary analytes (cholesterol, glucose, and lactate) [5]. This multiplexing assay enabled saving reagents, costs, and time, while increasing the overall clinical value of the test. Exploiting the microfluidics applied on a paper sheet, we realized a monolithic and fully integrated POC device, through a low-cost and fast $CO_{2}$ laser cutter. The platform showed excellent selectivity and multiplexing ability, with negligible interferences. The second part of this work was focused on the development of POC devices for the detection of anticancer drug contaminations in water solutions and urine samples. Antiblastic agents have revealed high toxicity for the exposed healthcare workers who prepare and administer these drugs in occupational environments [6]. Hence, continuous monitoring is highly required, and POCT shows tremendous potential in this context. With this aim, we realized a lateral-flow device (LFD) for the assessment of doxorubicin contaminations, using the fluorescent properties of the drug for naked-eye detection [7]. The pharmacological recognition of the dsDNA probe was exploited to overcome the lack of anti-doxorubicin antibodies. The highly sensitive strategy was successfully adapted to a real urine sample, without resorting to complex pretreatment procedures. Then, we developed a competitive LFD device for the detection of methotrexate (MTX). AuNPs were employed as the label molecules and the pharmacological competition of folic acid and MTX for the capture enzyme was used as the recognition mechanism, instead of costly antibodies.

Then, we developed a competitive LFD device for the detection of methotrexate (MTX). AuNPs were employed as the label molecules and the pharmacological competition of folic acid and MTX for the capture enzyme was used as the recognition mechanism, instead of costly antibodies. Despite the sensitivity requires further improvements, the strategy showed fast and reliable results, demonstrating a high potential for workers’ safety monitoring.",,,,, ,  2023 IEEE Nanotechnology Materials and Devices Conference (NMDC),,out_of_scope,
7087,"Title:Radiomics for Identification of Active Bone Marrow from CT: An Exploratory Study

 The radiation dose received by the pelvic Bone Marrow (BM) is a predictive factor for Hematologic Toxicity (HT) occurrence in the treatment of anal cancer. For this reason it is important to avoid BM during radiotherapy. In particular, the standard strategy in these cases consists in the identification of hematopoietically active BM (actBM), i.e. the part of BM in charge of blood cells generation, on 18FDG-PET, FLT-PET or MRI, but no approached have been developed for identifying actBM from CT images. This exploratory study aims to use radiomics for detecting actBM on CT sequences. Our approach is based on the extraction of 36 first-order and texture (second-order) features for each CT slice. These features are used as input of a Decision Tree (DT) classifier able to discriminate between active and inactive BM regions on the images. This method was applied to five patients affected by carcinoma of the anal canal and the obtained actBM segmentation was compared with the standard actBM identification from 18FDG-PET (reference standard, RS). Our results show that actBM identification in lumbosacral and iliac structures using radiomics overlaps the RS for more than 75% in 4 out of 5 patients.","Rosati, S., Balestra, G., Franco, P., Fiandra, C., Arcadipane, F., Silvetti, P., Ricardi, U., Gallio, E.",,,Radiomics for Identification of Active Bone Marrow from CT: An Exploratory Study,,,10.1109/LSC.2018.8572154 , ,2018,"The radiation dose received by the pelvic Bone Marrow (BM) is a predictive factor for Hematologic Toxicity (HT) occurrence in the treatment of anal cancer.

7100,"Title:Real-time measurement of toxicity: Application to nanotechnology and synthetic pathogens

 Cellular based biosensing can serve as an effective method for detection of unknown toxins by monitoring cellular response. Electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) does this by measuring the impedance of a cell monolayer grown on interdigitated gold electrodes. This is done in situ and in real time without disrupting the monolayer. As the monolayer settles and grows to confluence an increase in resistance is seen. The formation of tight junctions between the cells increases the resistance further until the resistance stabilizes with minor fluctuations due to micromotility. When the cells are exposed to a toxin a change in the barrier function, a measure of the resistance cause by tight junctions, is seen. This real time quantified data allows for continuous measurement of toxic exposure. Toxicity of copper nanoparticles (~100 nm) could be seen as low as 1 μg per 105 cells. Fluorescent stainingwas performed on parallel cultures to confirm the activity of the cells and the disruption of tight junctions over time.","Riggs, B., Plopper, G., Paluh, J.P., Chrisey, D.B.",,,Real-time measurement of toxicity: Application to nanotechnology and synthetic pathogens,,,10.1109/NEBC.2011.5778668 , ,2011,"Cellular based biosensing can serve as an effective method for detection of unknown toxins by monitoring cellular response.

 Aflatoxins are a kind of fungal toxin that causes great damage to humans and animals due to its wide distribution, secretive nature, and high toxicity. For the purpose of achieving qualitative and quantitative detection of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), a novel tri-taper-in-taper fiber-optic structure based on core mismatch of four-core fiber with a multimode fiber-based WaveFlex biosensor is developed and tested. The sensor probe's surface is coated with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). Multi-walled carbon nanotubes and zinc oxide nanoparticles are sequentially immobilized on the sensing probe surface to enhance the sensor's sensing capabilities. Then, the AFB1 antibody is utilized to functionalize the sensor to possess specific selectivity. After the modification of nanomaterials and the corresponding bioreceptors, the final sensor structure is formed.

 Early detection of unknown adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in postmarketing surveillance saves lives and prevents harmful consequences. We propose a novel data mining approach to signaling potential ADRs from electronic health databases. More specifically, we introduce potential causal association rules (PCARs) to represent the potential causal relationship between a drug and ICD-9 (CDC. (2010). International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9). [Online]. Available: http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd/icd9.html) coded signs or symptoms representing potential ADRs. Due to the infrequent nature of ADRs, the existing frequency-based data mining methods cannot effectively discover PCARs. We introduce a new interestingness measure, potential causal leverage, to quantify the degree of association of a PCAR. This measure is based on the computational, experience-based fuzzy recognition-primed decision (RPD) model that we developed previously (Y. Ji, R. M. Massanari, J. Ager, J. Yen, R. E. Miller, and H.

A. Klein, “A recognition-primed decision making model of rapid decision making,” in Decision Making in Action: Models and Methods, 1993, pp. 138-147).

To test our data mining approach, we retrieved electronic medical data for 16 206 patients treated by one or more than eight drugs of our interest at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Detroit between 2007 and 2009. We selected enalapril as the target drug for this ADR signal generation study. We used our algorithm to preliminarily evaluate the associations between enalapril and all the ICD-9 codes associated with it. The experimental results indicate that our approach has a potential to better signal potential ADRs than risk ratio and leverage, two traditional frequency-based measures.

 We investigate a new threat to neural sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models: training-time attacks that cause models to “spin” their outputs so as to support an adversary-chosen sentiment or point of view—but only when the input contains adversary-chosen trigger words. For example, a spinned 1 summarization model outputs positive summaries of any text that mentions the name of some individual or organization.Model spinning introduces a “meta-backdoor” into a model. Whereas conventional backdoors cause models to produce incorrect outputs on inputs with the trigger, outputs of spinned models preserve context and maintain standard accuracy metrics, yet also satisfy a meta-task chosen by the adversary.Model spinning enables propaganda-as-a-service, where propaganda is defined as biased speech. An adversary can create customized language models that produce desired spins for chosen triggers, then deploy these models to generate disinformation (a platform attack), or else inject them into ML training pipelines (a supply-chain attack), transferring malicious functionality to downstream models trained by victims.To demonstrate the feasibility of model spinning, we develop a new backdooring technique. It stacks an adversarial meta-task (e.g., sentiment analysis) onto a seq2seq model, backpropagates the desired meta-task output (e.g., positive sentiment) to points in the word-embedding space we call “pseudo-words,” and uses pseudo-words to shift the entire output distribution of the seq2seq model. We evaluate this attack on language generation, summarization, and translation models with different triggers and meta-tasks such as sentiment, toxicity, and entailment. Spinned models largely maintain their accuracy metrics (ROUGE and BLEU) while shifting their outputs to satisfy the adversary’s meta-task. We also show that, in the case of a supply-chain attack, the spin functionality transfers to downstream models.Finally, we propose a black-box, meta-task-independent defense that, given a list of candidate triggers, can detect models that selectively apply spin to inputs with any of these triggers.1We use “spinned” rather than “spun” to match how the word is used in public relations.","Bagdasaryan, Eugene, Shmatikov, Vitaly",,,Spinning Language Models: Risks of Propaganda-As-A-Service and Countermeasures,,,10.1109/SP46214.2022.9833572 , ,2022,"We investigate a new threat to neural sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models: training-time attacks that cause models to “spin” their outputs so as to support an adversary-chosen sentiment or point of view—but only when the input contains adversary-chosen trigger words.

Then, fast prefiltering techniques are employed to reduce the amount of pages that need to be examined by more precise, but slower, analysis tools (such as honey clients). While effective, these techniques require a substantial amount of resources. A key reason is that the crawler encounters many pages on the web that are benign, that is, the ""toxicity"" of the stream of URLs being analyzed is low. In this paper, we present EVILSEED, an approach to search the web more efficiently for pages that are likely malicious. EVILSEED starts from an initial seed of known, malicious web pages. Using this seed, our system automatically generates search engines queries to identify other malicious pages that are similar or related to the ones in the initial seed.

 Radiotherapy planning of head and neck cancer patients requires an accurate delineation of several organs at risk (OAR) from planning CT images in order to determine a dose plan which reduces toxicity and salvages normal tissue. However training a single deep neural network for multiple organs is highly sensitive to class imbalance and variability in size between several structures within the head and neck region. In this paper, we propose a single-class segmentation model for each OAR in order to handle class imbalance issues during training across output classes (one class per structure), where there exists a severe disparity between 12 OAR. Based on a U-net architecture, we present a transfer learning approach between similar OAR to leverage common learned features, as well as a simple weight averaging strategy to initialize a model as the average of multiple models, each trained on a separate organ. Experiments performed on an internal dataset of 200 H & N cancer patients treated with external beam radiotherapy, show the proposed model presents a significant improvement compared to the baseline multi-organ segmentation model, which attempts to simultaneously train several OAR.

In this paper, we propose a single-class segmentation model for each OAR in order to handle class imbalance issues during training across output classes (one class per structure), where there exists a severe disparity between 12 OAR. Based on a U-net architecture, we present a transfer learning approach between similar OAR to leverage common learned features, as well as a simple weight averaging strategy to initialize a model as the average of multiple models, each trained on a separate organ. Experiments performed on an internal dataset of 200 H & N cancer patients treated with external beam radiotherapy, show the proposed model presents a significant improvement compared to the baseline multi-organ segmentation model, which attempts to simultaneously train several OAR.

 Accurate segmentation of target tissues/structures as well as surrounding healthy organs/tissues (organs at risk (OARs)) plays a critical role in radiation therapy and treatment planning. Accurate segmentation of OARs prevents/minimizes unwanted toxicity to healthy tissues. Manual segmentation is time-consuming, tedious, prone to human errors and subject to intra- and inter-observer variability. In this regard, deep learning algorithms have shown extraordinary performance in automated organ segmentation from medical images, though the powerful/highly effective models might be computationally intensive. Transferring knowledge from complex/cumbersome models to simple/versatile models, known as knowledge distillation, has been proposed to address this issue (enhance the performance of the existing deep learning models). In this work, the impact of the knowledge distillation on OARs segmentation from CT images is investigated for commonly used Unet and Resnet deep learning models. To this end, a highly complex Unet model (as teacher) and two conventional deep learning models (Unet and Resnet as students) were developed to delineate OARs on thoracic CT images from the SegTHOR public dataset.

7137,"Title:Comparison of Machine Learning Algorithms and Oversampling Techniques for Urinary Toxicity Prediction After Prostate Cancer Radiotherapy

 Prostate cancer radiotherapy unavoidably involves the irradiation not only of the target volume, but also of healthy organs-at-risk, neighboring the prostate, likely causing adverse, toxicity-related side-effects. Specifically, in the case of urinary toxicity, these side effects might be associated with a variety of dosimetric, clinical and genetic factors, making its prediction particularly challenging. Given the inconsistency of available data concerning radiation-induced toxicity, it is crucial to develop robust models with superior predictive performance in order to perform tailored treatments. Machine Learning techniques emerge as appealing in this context, nevertheless without any consensus on the best algorithms to be used. This work proposes a comparison of several machine-learning strategies together with different minority class oversampling techniques for prediction of urinary toxicity following prostate cancer radiotherapy using dosimetric and clinical data. The performance of these classifiers was evaluated on the original dataset and using four different synthetic oversampling techniques.

 Modern radiotherapy delivers treatment plans optimised on an individual patient level, using CT-based 3D models of patient anatomy. This optimisation is fundamentally based on simple assumptions about the relationship between radiation dose delivered to the cancer (increased dose will increase cancer control) and normal tissue (increased dose will increase rate of side effects). The details of these relationships are still not well understood, especially for radiation-induced toxicity. We propose a convolutional neural network based on multiple instance learning to analyse toxicity relationships for patients receiving pelvic radiotherapy. A dataset comprising of 315 patients were included in this study; with 3D dose distributions, pre-treatment CT scans with annotated abdominal structures, and patient-reported toxicity scores provided for each participant. In addition, we propose a novel mechanism for segregating the attentions over space and dose/imaging features independently for a better understanding of the anatomical distribution of toxicity. Quantitative and qualitative experiments were performed to evaluate the network performance. The proposed network could predict toxicity with 80% accuracy. Attention analysis over space demonstrated that there was a significant association between radiation dose to the anterior and right iliac of the abdomen and patient-reported toxicity. Experimental results showed that the proposed network had outstanding performance for toxicity prediction, localisation and explanation with the ability of generalisation for an unseen dataset.","Elhaminia, Behnaz, Gilbert, Alexandra, Lilley, John, Abdar, Moloud, Frangi, Alejandro F., Scarsbrook, Andrew, Appelt, Ane, Gooya, Ali",,,Toxicity Prediction in Pelvic Radiotherapy Using Multiple Instance Learning and Cascaded Attention Layers,,,10.1109/JBHI.2023.3238825 , ,2023,"Modern radiotherapy delivers treatment plans optimised on an individual patient level, using CT-based 3D models of patient anatomy.

We conducted extensive experiments over 14 classic toxicity prediction tasks on three different benchmark datasets, including balanced and imbalanced ones.

 Due to the advance of modern computing technology, decisions can be made based on all the existing related data instances scattered across multiple data storages, such that available information has been entirely taken into consideration. Particularly in the predictive toxicology domain, because of the heterogeneity of data sources, multiple data instances with respect to the same endpoint are usually inconsistent, and the quality (or reliability) of the data instances is typically different. Also, the quantity of data instances is often not sufficient to conduct a study using conventional statistics-based methods. This paper presents a novel risk analysis approach for chemical toxicity assessment which considers all the available heterogeneous data instances in the same time, assisted by their quality (or reliability) values. The system is developed on the basis of possibility-probability distribution, where the uncertainty of the approximated probability values based on traditional statistics methods is represented by possibility. The uncertainty considered herein is led not only by the statistics on limited small number of data instances, but also by the poor quality (or reliability) of data instances. The possibility-probability distribution is automatically computed from available data instances by employing a modified diffused-interior-outer-set model (where the reliability of data is considered) based on information diffusion theory. Toxicity value for a given chemical compound is then estimated as the fuzzy expected value based on the resulted possibility-probability distribution.

7144,"Title:The Combination of Clinical, Dose-Related and Imaging Features Helps Predict Radiation-Induced Normal-Tissue Toxicity in Lung-cancer Patients -- An in-silico Trial Using Machine Learning Techniques

 The amount of delivered radiation dose to the tumor in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients is limited by the negative side effects on normal tissues. The most dose-limiting factor in radiotherapy is the radiation-induced lung toxicity (RILT). RILT is generally measured semi-quantitatively, by a dyspnea, or shortness-of-breath, score. In general, about 20-30% of patients develop RILT several months after treatment, and in about 70% of the patients the delivered dose is insufficient to control the tumor growth. Ideally, if the RILT score would be known in advance, then the dose treatment plan for the low-toxicity-risk patients could be adjusted so that higher dose is delivered to the tumor to better control it. A number of possible predictors of RILT have been proposed in the literature, including dose-related and clinical/demographic patient characteristics available prior to radiotherapy. In addition, the use of imaging features -- which are noninvasive in nature - has been gaining momentum. Thus, anatomic as well as functional/metabolic information from CT and PET scanner images respectively are used in daily clinical practice, which provide further information about the status of a patient. In this study we assessed whether machine learning techniques can successfully be applied to predict post-radiation lung damage, proxied by dyspnea score, based on clinical, dose-related (dosimetric) and image features. Our dataset included 78 NSCLC patients. The patients were divided into two groups: no-deterioration-of-dyspnea, and deterioration-of-dyspnea patients. Several machine-learning binary classifiers were applied to discriminate the two groups. The results, evaluated using the area under the ROC curve in a cross-validation procedure, are highly promising.

 Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to the development of transformer-based models that have shown success in identifying potential drug molecules for therapeutic purposes. However, for a molecule to be considered a viable drug candidate, it must exhibit certain desirable properties such as low toxicity, high druggability, and synthesizability. To address this, we propose an approach that incorporates prior knowledge about these properties during the model training process. In this study, we utilized the PubChem database, which contains 100 million molecules, to filter drug-like molecules based on the quantity of drug-likeliness (QED) score and the Pfizer rule. We then used this filtered dataset of drug-like molecules to train both molecular representation (ChemBERTa) and molecular generation models (MolGPT).

To address this, we propose an approach that incorporates prior knowledge about these properties during the model training process. In this study, we utilized the PubChem database, which contains 100 million molecules, to filter drug-like molecules based on the quantity of drug-likeliness (QED) score and the Pfizer rule.

 To improve the performance of the determination model for evaluating drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, exclusion, and toxicity (ADMET), a drug ADMET prediction model based on graph convolution network is proposed from the two chemical properties of drug solubility and toxicity. At the same time, a multilayer perceptron and an attention mechanism are introduced to improve the model by using special information such as features in molecular bonds and the difference in interaction strength between adjacent atoms. The error of the improved model is reduced by about 24% and 25% on average on two public data sets of drug solubility, and the accuracy of three public data sets of drug toxicity is increased by about 7.8% on average and 9.6 % at most.

 Glyphosate, one of the most popular herbicides world-wide, is used as an active ingredient in many commercial formulations. So far, many studies have focused on reproductive toxicity on glyphosate which may trigger epigenetic changes through endocrine-mediated mechanisms. Generally, it is critical to identify the glyphosate poisoning status in order to minimize health risks. This paper proposed a machine learning approach using 110 rats' samples to identify the glyphosate poisoning status. All rats were randomly divided into 2 groups (n = 55 each) in the study. The rats in the blank control group were given 0.9% sodium chloride solution orally for 15 days, while the other groups were administered orally at the dosage of 0.5g/kg of glyphosate once per day for 15 days consecutively. Consequently, the potential of an enhanced fuzzy k nearest neighbor approach was explored through blood routine test to recognize the glyphosate poisoning condition based on the blood indices. A real-life data set was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of classification accuracy (ACC), sensitivity, specificity, and Matthews Correlation Coefficients (MCC). The results demonstrated that there were significant differences in blood routine test indices between the control and the glyphosate groups (p-value <; 0.01). It was observed in the feature selection that the most important correlated indices were white blood cell , lymphocyte , intermediate cell, and neutrophil granulocyte. A comparative study with support vector machine and artificial neural networks had shown that the proposed approach could achieve much more promising results with 95.45% ACC, 0.90 MCC, 98.89% sensitivity, and 88.89% specificity.

Results are presented as a comparison of the two different approaches of features extraction and different classification algorithms.

Accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SE), specificity (SP), negative and positive predictive values (NPV and PPV) were evaluated for all lesions (per-lesion analysis) and patients (per-patient analysis) in the construction and validation sets. Best results were obtained in the per-lesion analysis from the 3D approach using a Support Vector Machine as classifier. We reached on the training set an ACC of 81%, while on test set, we obtained SE of 76%, SP of 67%, PPV of 69% and NPV of 75%. On the validation set a SE of 61%, SP of 60%, PPV of 57% and NPV of 64% were reached. The promising results obtained in the validation dataset should be extended to a larger cohort of patient to further validate our method.Clinical Relevance— to develop a radiomics signatures predicting single liver mts response to therapy.

 Drug-induced liver injury describes the adverse effects of drugs that damage the liver. Life-threatening results were also reported in severe cases. Therefore, liver toxicity is an important assessment for new drug candidates. These reports are documented in research papers that contain preliminary in vitro and in vivo experiments. Conventionally, data extraction from publications relies on resource-demanding manual labeling, which restricts the efficiency of the information extraction. The development of natural language processing techniques enables the automatic processing of biomedical texts. Herein, based on around 28,000 papers (titles and abstracts) provided by the Critical Assessment of Massive Data Analysis challenge, this study benchmarked model performances on filtering liver-damage-related literature. Among five text embedding techniques, the model using term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) and logistic regression outperformed others with an accuracy of 0.957 on the validation set. Furthermore, an ensemble model with similar overall performances was developed with a logistic regression model on the predicted probability given by separate models with different vectorization techniques. The ensemble model achieved a high accuracy of 0.954 and an F1 score of 0.955 in the hold-out validation data in the challenge. Moreover, important words in positive/negative predictions were identified via model interpretation. The prediction reliability was quantified with conformal prediction, which provides users with a control over the prediction uncertainty.

 Different agreement scores are widely used in social computing studies to evaluate the reliability of crowdsourced ratings. In this research, we argue that the concept of agreement is problematic for many rating tasks in computational social science because they are characterized by subjectivity. We demonstrate this claim by analyzing four social computing datasets that are rated by crowd workers, showing that the agreement ratings are low despite deploying proper instructions and platform settings. Findings indicate that the more subjective the rating task, the lower the agreement, suggesting that tasks differ by their inherent subjectivity and that measuring the agreement of social computing tasks might not be the optimal way to ensure data quality. When creating subjective tasks, the use of agreement metrics potentially gives a false picture of the consistency of crowd workers, as they over-simplify the reality of obtaining quality labels. We also provide empirical evidence on the stability of crowd ratings with a different number of raters, items, and categories, finding that the reliability scores are most sensitive to the number categories, somewhat less sensitive to the number of raters, and the least sensitive to the number of items.

 The evaluation of absorption, distribution, metabolism, exclusion, and toxicity (ADMET) properties plays a key role in a variety of domains including industrial chemicals, agrochemicals, cosmetics, environmental science, food chemistry, and particularly drug development. Since molecules are often intrinsically described as molecular graphs, graph neural networks have recently been studied to improve the prediction of ADMET properties. Among many graph neural networks published in recent years, Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) is a relatively recent and very promising one. In this paper, we propose an enhanced GIN, called MolGIN, via exploiting the bond features and differences influence of the atom neighbors to end-to-end predict ADMET properties. Based on GIN, MolGIN concatenates the bond feature together with node feature in the feature aggregator and applies a gate unit to adjust the atomic neighborhood weights to map the differences in the interaction strength between the central atom and its neighbors, such that more meaningful structural patterns of molecules can be explored toward better molecular modeling. Extensive experiments were conducted on seven public datasets to evaluate MolGIN against four baseline models with benchmark metrics. Experimental results of MolGIN were also compared with state-of-the-art results published in the last three years on each dataset.

 The liver is our very own chemical processing plant as it plays a vital role in maintaining the body's metabolic balance. Liver's health is assessed by a group of clinical tests (such as blood tests, ultrasonographic imaging, liver biopsy) most of which are invasive and burdensome for the patients. In the setting of severely scarred liver, toxic substances, such as ammonia, have fewer opportunities to be detoxified. Accumulation of ammonia in the systemic circulation and in the brain may result in Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE), a spectrum of neuropsychiatric abnormalities which entails changes in consciousness, intellectual functions, behavior. Minimal HE has attracted increasing attention, as it does not cause detectable changes in personality or behaviour, but the complex and sustained attention is impaired. Hence, it can be detected only by specific but biased, time-consuming and burdensome examinations, such as blood ammonia levels assessment and neuro-psychological tests. The obstrusivity of the majority of the liver function clinical tests, and, in case of minimal HE, the lack of reliable examinations, are encouraging the scientific community to look for alternative diagnostic methods. For this purpose, the exploitation of a non-invasive technique such as breath analysis, to identify chronic liver disease, discriminate among its degree of severity and detect the onset of HE, could be a step forward for clinical diagnosis.

Sensors incorporating well-packaged wavelength-stabilized near-IR (1.2-2.0 ¿m) laser sources sense over a dozen toxic or industrially-important gases.

Employing a 10-mW DFB laser, the eye-safe, battery-powered, 6-lb handheld remote methane leak detector illuminates a noncooperative topographic surface and analyzes returned scattered light to deduce the presence of excess methane. For aerial surveying, replacing the handheld transceiver with a large-aperture telescope and adding an erbium-doped fiber amplifier to the laser transmitter extends the standoff distance to 3000 m. By selecting a laser source having an appropriate wavelength, the standoff TDLAS tool detects trace concentrations of nonmethane hazardous gases, including several high-priority toxic industrial compounds and emissions from illicit chemical production laboratories. This paper also describes concepts for miniature integrated optic TDLAS sensors that combine a laser source, sampling section, and detector on a monolithic semiconductor materials system substrate.

Such chip-scale low-power integrated optic gas-phase chemical sensors may enable low-cost mass production, so that many hundreds or thousands of such sensors can be distributed cost-effectively over a wide area of interest and communicate via wireless networks.",,,,, ,  ,,out_of_scope,

A total of 35 mature male Wistar rats, weighing between 110 and 160g, were divided into seven groups of five rats each at random. Rats in groups A through D were fed diets supplemented with 1%, 2%, 5%, and 10% turmeric; group E received a pre-treatment of the conventional medication omeprazole (20 mg/kg) orally; and groups F and G received a 28-day supply of regular rat meal.

The effect(s) of turmeric rhizome powder on total protein concentration in serum, the selected organs mentioned above and kidney KIM-1 were determined. It was revealed from this study that there was increased serum total protein concentration of animals in F and D groups compared with animals in groups G and A-C with concomitant decrease in heart and kidney protein activities in concentration dependent manner.

 Studies examining traumatic brain injury have suggested a 'window of opportunity' exists for therapeutic agents to mitigate edema and cellular toxicity effectively. However, successful therapy also relies on identifying the extent of blood-brain barrier disruption, which is associated with excessive extra-cellular concentrations of ions, excitatory amino acids, and serum proteins. The following study investigates the use of pH-selective hydrous iridium oxide microelectrodes to assess trauma following insertion of a neural probe. Electrochemical activation of iridium microelectrode arrays was performed in either acidic (0.5 M H2SO4) or weak basic (0.3 M Na2HPO4, pH=8.56) solutions. Both oxides demonstrated super-Nernstian pH sensitivity (-88.5 mV/pH and -77.1 mV/pH, respectively) with little interference by other cations. Data suggest that acid-grown oxide provides better potential stability than base-grown oxide (sigma=2.8 versus 4.9 mV over 5 hours). Implantation of these electrodes into motor cortex and dorsal striatum revealed significant acidosis during and following insertion.

These chips are also immensely useful for rapid and accurate diagnosis of various diseases including malaria, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV), acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and for mitigating neglected tropical diseases (NTD) prevalent in the developing countries [5].",,,,, ,  2014 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD),,out_of_scope,
7189,"Title:A software-based predictive model for greenhouse gas mitigation: Towards environmental sustainability

 In the last years research-based programs relevant to sustainability have been developed. Some technological research programs are focused on the design of systems and processes that can be useful for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions as CO2. To diminish the negative impact caused by CO2 for global warming, its chemical transformation in Dimethyl Carbonate is a promising technology. Dimethyl Carbonate is a solvent with low toxicity and due to oxidative capacity can be used as fuel additive. In this work, the membrane reactor technology to improve the Dymethyl Carbonate production is explored from the perspective of modelling and simulation. As a result, a software-based model is implemented, in order to develop and couple different models for describing the membrane reactor. Simulation results showed that the membrane reactor, compared with conventional reactor, increase the reaction conversion and Dymethyl Carbonate production up to 67% and 78%, respectively. Finally, it can be seen that the solution obtained from software-based model allows to conclude that membrane reactor is a promising technology to mitigate CO2 emissions, allowing to achieve environmental sustainability.","Moncada, Sebastian Villegas, Palacio, Mauricio Gonzalez, Luna-delRisco, Mario, Orozco, Carlos Andres Arredondo, Jair, Jhon, Montealegre, Quiza, Imbachi, Jenny Cuantindoy, Diaz-Forero, Isabel",,,A software-based predictive model for greenhouse gas mitigation: Towards environmental sustainability,,,10.23919/CISTI.2018.8399195 , ,2018,"In the last years research-based programs relevant to sustainability have been developed.

 The clinical success of targeted cancer therapies is limited by the emergence of drug resistance often due to pre-existing tumor genetic heterogeneity and acquired, therapy-induced resistance. Targeted therapies have varied success in addressing metastatic disease, due to their ability to penetrate certain physiological compartments. This paper considers an evolutionary cancer model that incorporates tumor cell growth, mutation and compartmental migration and leverages recent results on the optimal control of monotone and convex systems to synthesize switching treatment strategies where a single drug or a predetermined combination of drugs is used at a given time. The need for switching is motivated by clinical considerations such as the limited effectiveness of any single targeted therapy against multiple resistance mechanisms arising in a single patient and the inability to design drug combinations at effective doses due to toxicity constraints. An optimal and clinically feasible switching therapy is obtained as the solution of a convex optimization problem that exploits the diagonally-dominant structure of the model. We demonstrate that this method yields an effective strategy in mitigating disease evolution in the presence of imperfect drug penetration in two compartments on an experimentally identified model of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-rearranged lung carcinoma.","Giordano, Giulia, Rantzer, Anders, Jonsson, Vanessa D.",,,A convex optimization approach to cancer treatment to address tumor heterogeneity and imperfect drug penetration in physiological compartments,,,10.1109/CDC.2016.7798636 , ,2016,"The clinical success of targeted cancer therapies is limited by the emergence of drug resistance often due to pre-existing tumor genetic heterogeneity and acquired, therapy-induced resistance.

7191,"Title:Latticed Channel Model of Touchable Communication Over Capillary Microcirculation Network

 Recent progress on bioresorbable and bio-compatible miniature systems provides prospects for developing novel nanorobots operating inside the human body. These nanoscale systems are expected to dissolve in vivo and cause no side effect after completing their tasks. Motivated by these advancements, we have developed the analytical framework of touchable molecular communication (TouchCom) to describe the process of direct drug targeting (DDT) using externally controllable nanorobots. Built upon our previous work, we develop a novel latticed channel model of TouchCom for an interconnected capillary network near a targeted tumor area. Specifically, we propose a two-dimensional grid to synthesize the microcirculation environment, which is used to describe the propagation process of nanorobots. Furthermore, by applying the concept of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems in wireless communications to the therapeutic window in cancer treatment, we propose a MIMO DDT strategy in the latticed channel to enhance the targeting efficiency while minimizing the adverse effect of drug toxicity. Based on the proposed model, we study the influence of blood flow direction on the efficiency of DDT, and introduce a compensation strategy with the help of an external guiding field to mitigate the misalignment between the direction of blood flow and the tumor location.","Zhou, Yu, Chen, Yifan",,,Latticed Channel Model of Touchable Communication Over Capillary Microcirculation Network,,,10.1109/TNB.2019.2943671 , ,2019,"Recent progress on bioresorbable and bio-compatible miniature systems provides prospects for developing novel nanorobots operating inside the human body.
